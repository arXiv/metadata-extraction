A relative theory is a boundary condition of a higher-dimensional topological quantum field
theory (TQFT), and carries a non-trivial defect group formed by mutually non-local defects
living in the relative theory. Prime examples are 6d N = (2, 0) theories that are boundary
conditions of 7d TQFTs, with the defect group arising from surface defects. In this paper, we
study codimension-two defects in 6d N = (2, 0) theories, and find that the line defects living
inside these codimension-two defects are mutually non-local and hence also form a defect
group. Thus, codimension-two defects in a 6d N = (2, 0) theory are relative defects living
inside a relative theory. These relative defects provide boundary conditions for topological
defects of the 7d bulk TQFT. A codimension-two defect carrying a non-trivial defect group
acts as an irregular puncture when used in the construction of 4d N = 2 Class S theories. The
defect group associated to such an irregular puncture provides extra "trapped" contributions
to the 1-form symmetries of the resulting Class S theories. We determine the defect groups
associated to large classes of both conformal and non-conformal irregular punctures. Along
the way, we discover many new classes of irregular punctures. A key role in the analysis of
defect groups is played by two different geometric descriptions of the punctures in Type IIB
string theory: one provided by isolated hypersurface singularities in Calabi-Yau threefolds,
and the other provided by ALE fibrations with monodromies.

Introduction

Recently, the study of higher-form symmetries [1 -- 3] has gained momentum [4 -- 58], as these
symmetries provide a lot of insight into deep physical phenomena in quantum field theories.
On the one hand, they provide insights into the phase structure and confinement properties in
the IR, while on the other hand, they provide insights into the properties of extended defects
in the UV. More abstractly, they encode information about the class of observables that can
be computed in a given quantum field theory, as a higher-symmetry is associated to a class of
backgrounds that can be turned on while computing correlation functions.

Higher-form symmetries are often entwined with a larger structure known as defect group1.
These are groups formed by equivalence classes of mutually non-local defects in a theory. The
non-locality of the defects implies that the theory is ill-defined on its own. For it to be well-
defined, the theory needs to arise on the boundary of a topological quantum field theory
(TQFT) in one higher dimension. We call such theories as relative theories2. On the other
hand, theories without mutually non-local defects are called absolute theories.

A natural generalization of the notion of a relative theory is the notion of a relative defect
inside a bulk theory. We define a relative defect to be a defect that carries mutually non-local
sub-defects. As a consequence, for a relative defect to be well-defined, it needs to be attached
to a topological system in one higher dimension. For a relative defect inside an absolute bulk
theory, the corresponding topological system is a TQFT. On the other hand, for a relative
defect inside a relative bulk theory, the corresponding system is a topological defect of the
TQFT associated to the relative bulk theory. The defect group of a relative defect captures

1This terminology was introduced in [4].
2An important note on terminology: Our definition of 'relative theory' differs from the definition employed
in the work [59] in a key manner. In that work, any theory arising on the boundary of a higher-dimensional
TQFT is called a relative theory, while a theory existing independently of a higher-dimensional TQFT is called
an absolute theory. According to this definition, the theories having a 't Hooft anomaly, which can be thought
of as theories living on the boundaries of SPT phases in one higher dimension, are relative theories. For us,
one important feature defining a relative theory is the existence of mutually non-local defects. Thus, we would
call a theory having a 't Hooft anomaly as an absolute theory rather than a relative theory.

higher-form symmetries localized on the worldvolume of the defect, along with its interplay
with the higher-form symmetries of the bulk theory.

In this paper, we show that codimension-two defects inside a bulk 6d N = (2, 0) theory
provide examples of relative defects inside a relative bulk theory. We find that line sub-defects
inside the codimension-two defects are mutually non-local and hence form a non-trivial defect
group in general.

One necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a codimension-two defect to be relative is
that it should provide an irregular puncture when used for the Class S construction of 4d N = 2
theories via compactification of 6d N = (2, 0) theories on punctured Riemann surfaces [60 -- 72].
In this context, an irregular puncture is defined as a singularity of a Higgs field (participating
in a Hitchin system on the Riemann surface) where poles of order higher than a simple pole
appear. On the other hand, a regular puncture is a singularity where only simple poles of the
Higgs field appear. This follows from the results of [31], which can be rephrased to state that
a codimension-two defect associated to a regular puncture carries a trivial defect group.

One interesting application of the defect groups associated to codimension-two defects is
in the computation of the 1-form symmetry of a 4d N = 2 Class S theory constructed using
irregular punctures. There are many interesting 4d N = 2 theories that lie in this class,
including 4d N = 2 Argyres-Douglas SCFTs and asymptotically free 4d N = 2 theories. Prior
work [31], building upon the works [1,73,74], has provided a general recipe for computing the
1-form symmetries of 4d N = 2 Class S theories involving only regular punctures. In this
work, we extend their analysis to include arbitrary irregular punctures. The defect groups
associated to the irregular punctures play a key role in this analysis.

When only regular punctures are involved, the 1-form symmetry is determined roughly
by the 1-cycles on the Riemann surface. When irregular punctures are involved, there are
extra contributions to the 1-form symmetry that are localized at the locations of the irregular
punctures. We call such extra contributions as trapped 1-form symmetries.

Striking examples of trapped 1-form symmetries are provided by Argyres-Douglas (AD)
theories of type AD[G, G0] that are constructed by compactifying 6d N = (2, 0) theories on
a sphere with a single puncture that is irregular. Such AD theories, and also a vast number
of other 4d N = 2 SCFTs, can also be constructed by compactifying Type IIB on canonical
isolated hypersurface Calabi-Yau three-fold singularities (IHS) X [17,29,30,36,55,75 -- 86], for a
recent review see [87]. Using string theoretic methods, the 1-form symmetries of these 4d N =
2 SCFTs can be computed from the topology of the boundary 5-manifold ∂X [17,29,30,36,55].
It is found that the 1-form symmetries of such AD theories are generally non-trivial. Since
the sphere used in the Class S construction does not carry any non-trivial 1-cycles, the 1-

5

form symmetries of these AD theories must be entirely trapped. Indeed, the general analysis
developed in this paper correctly reproduces the 1-form symmetries of these AD theories from
the defect groups associated to the irregular puncture.

The irregular punctures introduced in [81, 88, 89] will be called IHS punctures because
the 4d N = 2 SCFTs obtained by compactifying 6d N = (2, 0) theories on spheres with
these punctures can also be constructed by compactifying Type IIB on IHS singularities. For
untwisted punctures, this relationship was discussed in [81]. In this paper, we show that this
relationship can also be extended to the twisted punctures introduced in [81,89].

In addition to the punctures introduced in [81, 88, 89], we study many other classes of
irregular punctures. Many of these punctures have not appeared in prior literature. We
divide punctures into two classes: conformal and non-conformal punctures. The distinction is
made by considering the 4d N = 2 theory obtained by compactifying the 6d N = (2, 0) theory
corresponding to the puncture on a sphere with the puncture inserted at one point (and no
other punctures). If this 4d N = 2 theory is (super)conformal, then we call the puncture a
conformal puncture. On the other hand, if this 4d N = 2 theory is not conformal, then we
call the puncture a non-conformal puncture. For example, the IHS punctures are conformal
punctures. However, they are not all the conformal punctures, and we study many other
classes of conformal punctures that correspond to non-isolated singularities. In addition to
these, we also study many classes of non-conformal punctures. A subclass of the conformal and
non-conformal punctures considered in this paper can be constructed using Hanany-Witten
brane constructions [90 -- 93] in Type IIA superstring theory.

The bulk of this paper is devoted to the computation of defect groups associated to
codimension-two defects in 6d N = (2, 0) theories of types A, D and E. To each (confor-
mal or non-conformal) puncture, we associate a 4d N = 2 generalized quiver theory having
the property that the 1-form symmetry of the generalized quiver determines completely the
data associated to the defect group of the puncture. Such a theory is a gauge theory con-
taining various kinds of gauge algebras, but the matter content can be provided not only by
hypermultiplets, but also by strongly coupled 4d N = 2 SCFTs that we call "matter SCFTs".
The 1-form symmetry of the generalized quiver theory, and hence all the data associated to
the defect group of the puncture, is computed using the properties of the matter SCFTs.

For the punctures admitting a Type IIA construction, the generalized quiver is simply read
off from the associated brane configuration. On the other hand, for punctures not admitting a
Type IIA construction, the associated generalized quiver is conjectural, and we provide many
pieces of evidence to support this conjecture, that we discuss below.

First of all, a piece of the defect group (that contains both trapped and non-trapped

6

parts) can be computed by using the data of the Higgs field in the vicinity of the puncture.
Using the data of the Higgs field, one can realize the puncture by compactifying Type IIB
on an ALE fibration over a punctured plane. The monodromy of the Higgs field around
the puncture captures the monodromy of the ALE fibration. Now one can apply the tools
developed in [17,29,30,36,55] to deduce this piece of the defect group of the puncture from the
data of the monodromy of the ALE fibration. However, this doesn't provide full information
related to the defect group.

Second, for the IHS punctures, the trapped part of the defect group can be computed using
Type IIB compactified on the corresponding IHS singularity, using the technology developed
in [17, 29, 30, 36, 55]. The obtained trapped defect group can then be checked against the
trapped defect group predicted by the conjecture. However, this does not provide information
on the non-trapped part of the defect group.

Third, we use other types of IHS singularities discussed in [29] that construct 4d N =
2 trinion theories. These trinion theories are composed out of the data of three irregular
punctures. The defect group of a trinion theory can be obtained using the data of the defect
groups of the three punctures, and it involves not only the trapped parts of these defect groups,
but also some of the non-trapped parts. On the other hand, the defect group of the trinion
theory can be independently obtained as in [29]. Matching the two results provides a check
for the non-trapped part of the defect groups of punctures predicted by our proposal.

Finally, for untwisted A type punctures, the defect group of the puncture can be read from
the 1-form symmetry of a 3d Lagrangian theory obtained by circle reduction of a 4d N = 2
Class S theory constructed using the puncture (and a P0 puncture). This provides another
check for our proposal.

We also study the defect groups of untwisted IHS punctures for the E-type (2, 0) theory.
For such punctures, we can compute the trapped part of the defect group using the IHS
singularity. Moreover, using the ALE fibration description, we can also compute a piece
containing a combination of trapped and non-trapped parts. Now, it turns out for such IHS
punctures, that these two pieces of information is enough to determine the whole information
about the defect group associated to these punctures.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses generalities about
relative theories and relative defects. Section 3 provides evidence for the existence of 1-form
symmetries trapped inside irregular punctures. Section 4 describes how the 1-form symmetry
of an arbitrary class S theory can be described in terms of defect groups associated to the
participating punctures. Section 5 discusses various techniques we use for computing the
defect groups associated to punctures. In particular, subsection 5.3 discusses the computation

7

of (part of) defect group associated to a puncture by realizing it as an ALE fibration with a
monodromy in Type IIB string theory. Section 6 discusses the map between IHS punctures
and IHS singularities. Using these IHS singularities, we compute the trapped parts of the
defect groups associated to IHS punctures. Sections 7, 8 and 9 discuss our main proposals for
computing defect groups associated to large classes of untwisted A- and D-types, and twisted
D-type punctures. The explicit forms of the defect groups are provided, and many checks are
performed by computing parts of these defect groups via other methods. Section 10 computes
the defect groups of untwisted E-type IHS punctures by combining the results of the IHS
computation with the results of the ALE fibration computation. Finally, we have a couple
of appendices. Appendix A provides a glossary of the most frequently used notations in the
paper. Appendix B presents the Mathematica code used to derive the monodromy action on
the spectral cover sheets about arbitrary punctures which is the key piece of data informing
the boundary topology in ALE fibration picture.

2 Relative Defects and Relative Theories

We begin by discussing the notions of relative theories and relative defects. This is important
because our starting point, namely 6d N = (2, 0) theories, are relative theories. We are
interested in understanding the 1-form symmetries of 4d N = 2 Class S theories obtained
by compactifying 6d N = (2, 0) theories with arbitrary regular and irregular punctures. The
contribution to the 1-form symmetry of the irregular puncture is encoded in a defect group
associated to the puncture, which in turn is associated to the fact that these punctures are
relative codimension-two defects inside 6d N = (2, 0) theories.

2.1 Relative Theories
Non-locality of defects. Many interesting theories are relative [3, 4, 25, 59, 94 -- 96]. That
is, they carry defects that are mutually non-local. In such theories, the non-locality occurs
between p-dimensional defects and (d − p − 2)-dimensional defects, where d is the spacetime
dimension of the relative theory. The non-locality exhibits itself as a phase ambiguity in defin-
ing correlation functions of these defects. Consider such a relative theory Td on a Euclidean
spacetime manifold Md. Consider the correlation function on Md of a p-dimensional defect Dp
inserted along a sub-manifold Σp, and a (d − p − 2)-dimensional defect Dd−p−2 inserted along
a sub-manifold Σd−p−2. As Σp is moved in a loop around Σd−p−2, the correlation function
comes back to itself along with an additional phase

where D

E ∈ R/Z captures the mutual non-locality between the defects Dp and

Dp, Dd−p−2

Dd−p−2. Thus the correlation function under consideration suffers from the above phase
ambiguity.

Examples of relative theories. Well-known examples of relative theories are 2d chiral
RCFTs [97 -- 102], for which the non-locality is exhibited by local operators (i.e. 0-dimensional
defects) associated to modules of the chiral algebras. Another class of well-known examples
are 6d N = (2, 0) SCFTs [94] specified by Lie algebras Am, Dn, E6 and E7 (but not E8), for
which the non-locality is exhibited by 2-dimensional surface defects in these theories.

TQFT associated to a relative theory. Such a relative theory Td is better understood
as a non-topological boundary condition of a non-invertible (d+1)-dimensional TQFT Sd+1
3.
The TQFT carries invertible topological defects4 described by a group

L = d−1Y

p=1

Lp = L1 × L2 × ··· × Ld−2 × Ld−1 ,

(2.2)

where Lp is the abelian group formed by p-dimensional topological defects under fusion. The p-
dimensional topological defects braid non-trivially with (d−p)-dimensional topological defects.
The braiding defines a bi-homomorphism

h·,·i : Lp × Ld−p → R/Z .

(2.3)

∼= bLp .

Ld−p

Moreover the bi-homomorphism is such that it makes Ld−p isomorphic to the Pontraygin dual
bLp of Lp. That is,

(2.4)
These bihomomorphisms define what we call a pairing on the group L. In addition to the
Lp participating in L, one can additionally consider a group Ld of d-dimensional invertible
topological defects in the TQFT Sd+1, that may have a non-trivial action on the topological
defects in Lp<d.

The group Lp forms the (d−p)-form symmetry group of the TQFT Sd+1. Thus L captures
the higher-form symmetries of Sd+1, and Ld captures 0-form symmetries (that can act on the
higher-form symmetries valued in L). The pairing on L describes 't Hooft anomalies between
these higher-form symmetries.

3This is sometimes also referred to as the Symmetry TFT, or SymTFT in [57].
4There can also be non-invertible topological defects that we ignore in what follows. We will consider some
properties of such non-invertible topological defects when we discuss relative defects in relative theories later.

Non-locality from braiding. The p-dimensional defects Dp of the relative theory Td arise
at the end-points of the (p + 1)-dimensional topological defects of the TQFT Sd+1. This
includes both invertible and non-invertible (p + 1)-dimensional defects. For example, for
the surface defects of 6d N = (2, 0) theories, the corresponding topological 3-dimensional
defects are all invertible. On the other hand, for the local operators of chiral RCFTs, the
corresponding topological line defects include both invertible and non-invertible ones. The
non-locality of these defects of the relative theory can now be understood in terms of braiding
of the corresponding topological defects of the TQFT.

Restricting ourselves to the invertibles, let us consider two defects Dp and Dd−p−2 of the
relative theory arising at the end-points of topological defects αp ∈ Lp+1 and αd−p−2 ∈ Ld−p−1
respectively. Then, we have the equality

where the left hand side captures the non-locality between Dp and Dd−p−2, while the right hand

Equivalence classes of defects under screenings. For p > 0, each (p + 1)-dimensional
topological defect (that cannot be expressed as a sum of other (p + 1)-dimensional topological
defects) of the TQFT Sd+1 characterizes an equivalence class of p-dimensional defects of the
relative theory Td. Two p-dimensional defects Dp and D0
are in the same equivalence class if
there exists a (p − 1)-dimensional junction Jp−1 defect at the intersection of Dp and D0
. See

Table 1: Defect group L3, its pairing h·,·i and the 0-form group Og for 6d N = (2, 0) theory of
type g. Trivial groups are denoted by zero. We denote a generator of L3 for g = An−1, E6, E7
as f; a generator of L3 for g = D2n+1 as s; and generators of L3 ' Z2 × Z2 for g = D2n as
s, c. S3 denotes the group formed by permutations of three objects.

6d N = (2, 0) theories as relative theories. The group L, along with the pairing on it, is
often referred to as the defect group of the relative theory Td. For example, the defect group
of a 6d N = (2, 0) SCFT specified by an A, D, E algebra g is completely localized in L3 and
takes the form

L = L3 = bZG ,

(2.6)

where bZG is the Pontryagin dual of the center ZG of the simply connected group G associated
to the Lie algebra g. The pairing on L is just a bi-homomorphism L3×L3 = bZG×bZG → R/Z.
The above bi-homomorphism bZG × bZG → R/Z provides an isomorphism bZG → ZG that will
feature prominently in the later parts of the paper. A 6d N = (2, 0) SCFT of type g also
contains a non-trivial

(2.7)
where Og is the group formed by outer-automorphisms of g. There is furthermore an action of
Ld on L, which is just the natural action of Og on bZG. The data of the defect group, pairing

and outer-automorphism group for different values of g is tabulated in table 1.

2.2 Absolute Theories from Relative Theories
Polarization. Starting from a relative theory, one can construct many absolute theories,
where an absolute theory is defined by the fact that its genuine5 defects do not have any
non-locality. Thus the correlation functions of genuine defects in an absolute theory do not
suffer from phase ambiguities. A general procedure for constructing absolute theories out of
a relative theory Td employs the use of a topological boundary condition6 BΛ
of the TQFT
Sd+1. An absolute d-dimensional theory TΛ
is then obtained by compactifying the TQFT
Sd+1 on an interval, with the relative theory Td placed at one end of the interval, and the
topological boundary condition BΛ

placed at the other end of the interval. See figure 3.

5We call a defect genuine if it can be defined independently of any higher-dimensional defects. On the other
hand, a non-genuine defect is one that arises at the junctions, boundaries or corners of other higher-dimensional
defects.

6Since we regard theories with anomalies as absolute theories, what we call a topological boundary condition
is not actually a boundary condition when there are anomalies. In general, BΛ
d is a topological interface between
the TQFT Sd+1 and the (d + 1)-dimensional SPT phase capturing the anomaly. See figure 3. For convenience,
we will refer to BΛ

d as a 'topological boundary condition of the TQFT Sd+1' in what follows.

7Here we only consider what are called pure polarizations in [25]. There can also be mixed polarizations

that are discussed in that paper.

2.3 Relative Defects in Absolute Theories
In an analogous way, we define relative defects as those defects that carry mutually non-local
sub-defects. The sub-defects are constrained to live in the worldvolume of the relative defect.
See figure 7.

Let us begin by considering relative defects in absolute theories. The structure of such a
relative defect is very similar to that of a relative theory. In fact, we can apply the whole ma-
chinery discussed in previous subsections, but now regarding Td not as a relative d-dimensional
theory, but instead a relative d-dimensional defect inside an absolute D-dimensional theory

defect interacts non-trivially with the defect group of relative theory itself.

Topological defect associated to relative defect. We consider a d-dimensional relative
defect Td in a D-dimensional relative theory TD for d < D. The relative theory is attached
to a (D + 1)-dimensional TQFT SD+1, and the relative defect is attached to a non-invertible
(d + 1)-dimensional topological defect Sd+1 of the TQFT SD+1. See figure 10.

Let LD be the defect group of the TQFT SD+1. The (p + 1)-dimensional topological
defects of SD+1 valued in LD,p+1 can end on the topological defect Sd+1 as long as p ≤ d.
Thus, a general invertible p-dimensional topological sub-defect of the topological defect Sd+1
comes attached to an invertible (p + 1)-dimensional topological defect of the TQFT SD+1.
See figure 11. Let Ld,p be the group of invertible p-dimensional sub-defects of Sd+1. Then,
we have a map

(2.14)
that maps a p-dimensional sub-defect of Sd+1 to the bulk (p + 1)-dimensional topological
defect to which the p-dimensional sub-defect is attached to. The kernel of this projection map

L0

d,p

(2.15)

Another interplay between the groups Ld,p and LD is as follows. Let SD−d−1 be a (D −
d − 1)-dimensional sphere that links the worldvolume of Sd+1 in a small neighborhood of

topological defects of the bulk theory SD+1, nor can be obtained from them via the squeezing
procedure discussed above.

We have non-trivial braidings between elements of Ld,p and elements of Ld,d−p that imply

Non-locality of sub-defects. We call Ld the defect group associated to the relative defect
Td. We have seen above that this defect group has a non-trivial interplay with the defect
group LD of the relative theory TD. Ld,p+1 captures (some of) the equivalence classes of p-
dimensional sub-defects of the relative defect Td. The p-dimensional sub-defects of the relative
defect Td in general arise at the ends of the (p + 1)-dimensional defects of the relative theory
TD. Consider such a p-dimensional sub-defect Dd,p of the relative defect Td that arises at
the end of a (p + 1)-dimensional defect DD,p+1 of the relative theory TD. Moreover, let the
defect DD,p+1 lie in an equivalence class αD,p+1 ∈ LD,p+2, and the sub-defect Dd,p lie in an
equivalence class αd,p ∈ Ld,p+1. Then, we have the relation

αD,p+1 = πp+1(αd,p) .

(2.21)

The pairing on Ld captures non-locality of these sub-defects as they are moved around within
the worldvolume of the relative defect Td.

Twisted sector relative defects. Assume that the TQFT SD+1 has a 0-form symmetry
group LD,D. Let the ends of the topological defects valued in LD,D at the location of the
relative theory TD give rise to topological defects of the relative theory TD that are also valued
in LD,D. Then, we can consider codimension-two relative defects Td=D−2 of the relative theory
TD that arise at the end of a topological codimension-one defect α ∈ LD,D of TD. For such
a relative defect, the non-invertible topological defect Sd+1=D−1 also arises at the end of the
codimension-one topological defect α ∈ LD,D of the TQFT SD+1.

The (not necessarily topological) defects that arise at the ends of p-form symmetry gen-
erating topological defects are called twisted sector defects for the p-form symmetry. In this
language, the above discussed codimension-two relative defects and the topological defect
Sd+1=D−1 are twisted sector defects for the 0-form symmetry LD,D.

24

The defect group of such a twisted sector relative defect has almost the same structure as
for the untwisted relative defects discussed above, though there are slight modifications due
to the action of LD,D on LD,p for p < D. The co-domain of the map πp is the group obtained
by modding out LD,p+1 by the action of α ∈ LD,D. On the other hand, the domain of the
map sd−p is the subgroup of LD,D−p−1 left invariant by the action of α ∈ LD,D.

2.5 Relative Defects in 6d (2, 0) Theories
In this paper we study codimension-two defects of 6d N = (2, 0) theories, and find that in
general such defects are relative defects. Since 6d N = (2, 0) theories are relative theories, we
obtain examples of the case of relative defects inside relative theories discussed in the previous
subsection. This is a specialization of the general analysis so far to the case of

D = 6 ,

d = 4 .

(2.30)

Below, we will keep the subscripts d and D for ease of comparison with the earlier analysis.
Recall that a 6d (2, 0) theory of type g has defect group

LD = LD,3 = bZG .

A codimension-two defect (meaning d = 4) of the 6d (2, 0) theory has in general a defect group

Ld = Ld,1 × Ld,2 × Ld,3 .

(2.32)

In this paper, we study only the Ld,2 part of the defect group, while leaving the study of
Ld,1 × Ld,3 part of the defect group to future works. In fact, Ld,2 is the more interesting part
of Ld as it can interact with the defect group LD = LD,3 of the 6d (2, 0) theory itself. Ld,2
captures equivalence classes of non-topological line defects in the relative codimension-two
defect.

We find that Ld,2 can be expressed as

with the pairing on Ld,2 being such that it provides an isomorphism W → bH. That is, we can

(2.31)

(2.33)

(2.34)

(2.35)

write

where bH is the Pontryagin dual of H. Moreover, we have
L0
d,2 = W × HT ,

Ld,2 = W × H

W ∼= bH ,

25

where HT is a subgroup of H and L0

d,2 is the kernel of the map

π2 : Ld,2 → LD,3

(2.36)

describing which line defects of the codimension-two defect arise at the ends of surface defects
of the bulk 6d N = (2, 0) theory.

Dually, the image Im(s2) of the map

s2 : LD,3 → Ld,2

(2.37)

relating surface defects of the (2, 0) theory and line defects of the codimension-two defect via
the squeezing procedure, is such that

Im(s2) ⊆ W ⊂ Ld,2 .

Let us define

This allows us to express the trapped part LT

W T := W/Im(s2) .
d,2 of Ld,2 as

LT
d,2 = L0

d,2/Im(s2) = W T × HT .
W T ∼= bHT ,

The pairing on Ld,2 descends to a pairing on LT

d,2 which is such that it provides an isomorphism
(2.41)
where bHT is the Pontryagin dual of HT . We also discuss twisted codimension-two defects that

arise at the ends of topological codimension-one defects implementing the outer-automorphism
0-form symmetries, and they have a similar structure as discussed above.

The defect group eLd of the resulting theory eTd obtains contributions not only from the
defect group LD of the parent theory TD, but also from the defect group Li
employed in the compactification. In particular, the component eLd,p will obtain

We are interested in computing the component eLd,2 of the defect group eLd of the Class
S theory eTd. This component characterizes equivalence classes of line defects in the Class
S theory.
It receives contributions from the surface defects of the (2, 0) theory valued in
LD = LD,3 and compactified along 1-cycles of the Riemann surface Σ2. These kinds of
contributions have been studied extensively in the past literature [1,31,73,74].

However, as discussed above, there are also contributions from the line defects of the

relative defects valued in Li

d,2 that we determine in this paper.

3 Evidence for Trapped 1-Form Symmetries

There is much evidence for the existence of additional sources of 1-form symmetries in Class
S theories, coming from the punctures used in the Class S construction. We will present two:
Type IIB constructions of 4d N = 2 SCFTs using isolated hypersurface singularities (IHS)
can have non-trivial 1-form symmetries. In turn, some of these theories have a realization
as class S theories based on a sphere with a single irregular puncture. We will develop the
dictionary between irregular punctures and IHS in section 6. This correspondence then very
strongly suggests that irregular punctures have trapped 1-form symmetries! This is because
a sphere has no non-trivial 1-cycles that can give rise to the usual type of 1-form symmetries
in Class S theories that were discussed in [31].

The second motivation comes from the collision of regular punctures, to result in irregular
ones. If the setup with regular punctures had 1-form symmetry, then again it is indicative that
the resulting theory with irregular punctures should also have this symmetry, again pointing
towards the existence of trapped 1-form symmetries.

3.1 The Defect Group of Type IIB on IHS

with ai ≥ 0, where K is the canonical class, and Si the exceptional divisors of the resolution,
are called canonical singularities. When ai > 0 the singularity is terminal, and if ai = 0 for
all i it admits a crepant (i.e. Calabi-Yau) resolution.

i

27

The type of Calabi-Yau singularities that we will consider in this paper are so-called
isolated hypersurface singularities (IHS): these are hypersurface equations in C4, of the type

P(x1, x2, x3, x4) = 0 ,

(3.2)

where P is a polynomnial in xi, satisfying various requirements, e.g.
the existence of an
isolated canonical singularity.
IHSs can be classified and we refer to this as the Kreuzer-
Skarke-Yau-Yu (KS-YY) classification [79, 85]. To specify an IHS we will use the notation
in [55], which indicates the type and vanishing orders of P.

In [17,29,30,36,55] the deformation theory of the isolated hypersurface singularity (IHS)
realization of such 4d N = 2 theories was used to compute the line defects, and thereby 1-form
symmetry. This is computed from the homology of the link

where

LX = Tor ker(h2) ⊆ H2(∂X, Z) ,

h2 : H2(∂X, Z) → H2(X, Z)

(3.3)

(3.4)

is the map lifting a 2-cycle on the boundary ∂X to a 2-cycle in the bulk X. The pairing on
LX descends from the linking pairing on H2(∂X, Z).

The line defects are D3-branes wrapped on relative 3-cycles, (modulo screening by local
operators realized as D3-branes on compact 3-cycles). This in turn can be identified with the
homology H2(∂X, Z) of the link, under the assumption that there is no torsion in the second
homology of the bulk X. We will provide explicit examples of these defect groups in the
following. Here we should note that they can be computed from the hypersurface singularity
using the code in [55]. Examples are AD theories of type AD[G, G0], with certain choices for
(G, G0) = (A, D), (A, E), (D, D).

The non-triviality of the defect groups of lines for such IHS has an important, quite central,
implication for class S construction: We will see in section 6 that many of these hypersurfaces
have realizations as class S with a single irregular puncture P on a sphere. The results from
the IHS realization imply that there are trapped line operators denoted by LTP in such class
S theories.
In their Type IIB realization on the singularity XP correspond to the relative
homology groups (3.3):

(3.5)
Thus, the trapped defect group LTP of a puncture P lying in the IHS class can be computed
from the data of the Calabi-Yau singularity XP associated to P using the techniques of [30,55],
which can be applied to any IHS. The relative homology groups are computed in these cases by

LTP = LXP .

28

using the deformation data of the IHS. We will not review this, but provide the results from
these computations in the subsequent sections, which provide a prediction for the trapped
part of the defect group for Class S theories.

3.2 Collisions of Regular Punctures
4d N = 2 theories of class S constructed purely from regular twisted punctures can carry a
non-trivial defect group of lines [31]. In many cases irregular punctures arise from operations
on these theories, examples for such operations include the collision of punctures, gauging
of flavor symmetries and (de)coupling of matter. The defect group associated with irregular
punctures can therefore be bootstrapped from the results in [31] whenever the consequences
of these operations on defect groups is understood. Here we will adopt this approach to show
that irregular punctures must in general carry a nontrivial trapped defect group. It is enough
to consider a simple set of Lagrangian theories to illustrate this.

As is well known, most 4d N = 2 conformal linear quivers admit a class S description
involving a collection of regular punctures on a sphere and in particular we will be concerned
here with orthosymplectic quivers (alternating so and usp gauge algebras with bifundamental
half-hypermultiplets in between), which are realized by compactifying the 6d N = (2, 0) theory
of type D on a sphere with both twisted and untwisted regular punctures. Qualitatively, the
structure of such theories is as follows: there is a central part of the quiver in which the ranks
of the gauge algebras stay constant and the quiver locally looks like . . . usp(2N −2)−so(2N)−
usp(2N−2) . . . This pattern is reproduced by gluing together a collection of trinions with a full
untwisted and two twisted punctures, one full and the other minimal. This trinion describes
the half-hypermultiplet in the bifundamental of usp(2N − 2) × so(2N). This central part of
the quiver is decorated at both ends by tails, whose gauge nodes display decreasing rank as we
move towards the ends of the quiver. Many such tails are possible and in the class S formalism
the choice of tail translates into the choice of regular puncture. The dictionary between DN
punctures (both twisted and untwisted) and quiver tails is described in detail in [61]. Overall,
if we have a conformal linear quiver with k gauge groups, the class S description involves
k + 3 regular punctures on the sphere. k + 1 of them are minimal twisted and the other two
determine the structure of the tails.

As a special case of this construction, we can consider the following linear quivers:
k even : N + n − 1 − so(2N) − usp(2N − 2n − 2) − ··· − so(4n + 2) − usp(2n) − 1
k odd : N + n − 1 − so(2N) − usp(2N − 2n − 2) − ··· − usp(4n) − so(2n + 2) .

(3.6)

which carry a non-trivial defect group of lines. Every so gauge algebra contributes a Z2
2 factor
to the defect group. For every n < N these linear quivers can be realized using the 6d theory

of type DN with regular punctures only. We display the corresponding punctured spheres in
figure 17. The tails on the left are trivial and the corresponding puncture is full twisted.

Notice that the flavor symmetry of our quivers is larger than that we naively expect from
the class S description, since the full twisted puncture carries usp(2N − 2) flavor symmetry
but from the flavors on the left end of the quivers we get usp(2N + 2n− 2). This is the crucial
feature we need for our analysis, as we will now see.

The next step is to give infinite mass to n fundamentals of so(2N) in (3.6), so that they
decouple. This move clearly does not change the defect group of lines of the theory since we
are not decoupling N − 1 of the remaining flavors. After this modification the so(2N) gauge
algebra is no longer conformal and therefore the new quivers cannot be described using regular
punctures only. We therefore ask if we can still provide a class S description. The answer is
yes but we need to introduce irregular punctures. Indeed the conformal quivers
k even : N − usp(2N − 2n − 2) − ··· − so(4n + 2) − usp(2n) − 1
k odd : N − usp(2N − 2n − 2) − ··· − usp(4n) − so(2n + 2) .

(3.7)

are known to be described by a 6d N = (2, 0) DN theory on a sphere with a full untwisted punc-
ture and an irregular puncture [103]. In that reference these theories were dubbed Dk(SO(2N))
and we will discuss them more in detail later. The only difference between the quivers (3.7)
and those in (3.6) after the mass deformation is the gauging of the so(2N) flavor symmetry
and the addition of the N−1 flavors. This modification is easily implemented in class S since it
simply corresponds to gluing the sphere with the irregular puncture together with the trinion
we described before (full and minimal twisted punctures and full untwisted puncture). The
resulting Riemann surface is a sphere with the irregular puncture and two twisted punctures,
one full and one minimal. This is depicted in figure 18 where we denote with Pk the irregular
puncture.

By comparing figures 17 and 18 we see that the effect of the mass deformation, which does

not change the defect group, is to induce the collision of the k + 1 regular punctures into the
irregular puncture Pk. This irregular puncture must carry trapped defect group of lines, as
the 1-cycles on the Riemann surface shown in figure 18 do not give rise to any non-trivial
defect group.

In fact, the existence of trapped defect groups inside Pk can be understood as follows.
Consider a configuration of four twisted regular punctures shown in figure 19. As discussed
in [31], each of the cycles A and B contributes a Z2 group of line defects. As we collide the
four punctures together, the A and B cycles, and hence the contributions associated to them,
become trapped at the puncture.

The above analysis shows that irregular punctures can carry nontrivial trapped defect
groups that can provide trapped contributions to one-form symmetries of absolute 4d N = 2
Class S theories. The Lagrangian theories we have just discussed represent special cases of this
phenomenon and in the rest of this paper we will explain how to determine the contribution
from irregular punctures to the defect group of line defects.

1-Form Symmetries of Arbitrary Class S Theories

Here we discuss the computation of 1-form symmetry of an arbitrary Class S theory obtained
by compactifying a 6d N = (2, 0) theory of A, D, E type an arbitrary genus g Riemann surface
containing arbitrary number of twisted and untwisted, regular and irregular punctures, along

31

with an arbitrary number of closed outer-automorphism twist lines.

The 1-form symmetry of the Class S theory can be expressed in terms of data associated
to the punctures participating in the class S construction. This data associated to punctures
is referred to as the defect group associated to the punctures.

Thus, using the analysis presented in this section, one can reduce the computation of 1-form
symmetries of Class S theories to the computation of defect groups associated to punctures.
We discuss the computations of defect groups of punctures in the following sections.

4.1 The Defect Group of a Puncture
Decomposition into electric and magnetic lines. A codimension-two defect (i.e. a
puncture10) P is characterized by a defect group of line defects

LP = WP × HP .

The "electric" part WP is Pontryagin dual to the "magnetic" part HP, i.e.

WP = bHP .

The pairing for two elements (w1, h1), (w2, h2) ∈ WP × HP is given by

(4.1)

where hw, hi ∈ R/Z is given by applying the element w ∈ bHP on the element h ∈ HP.
Magnetic lines and their relationship to surface defects. The elements of HP are line
defects living on P that arise at the ends of surface defects11 of the bulk 6d N = (2, 0) theory
ending on the co-dimension-two defect P. See figure 20.
eπP : HP → S6d

Thus, for an untwisted puncture, there is a natural projection map

(4.4)

that forgets the data of the line defect arising at the end, and spits out only the bulk surface
defect. The bulk surface defects are valued in a group S6d which we identify with the group
10Here we consider both untwisted and twisted punctures. The codimension-two defect associated to an
untwisted puncture is a genuine codimension-two defect of the 6d theory. On the other hand, the codimension-
two defect associated to a twisted puncture is a non-genuine codimension-two defect of the 6d theory that lives
at the end of a codimension-one topological defect associated to an outer-automorphism 0-form symmetry of
the 6d theory.
11These are not all such line defects: In fact, a general element of α ∈ HP ×WP arises at the end of a surface
defect. The key point is that the bulk surface defect depends only on the projection of α onto the HP factor,
but does not depend on the projection of α onto the WP factor.

bZG Pontryagin dual to the center ZG of the simply connected group G associated to the A,D,E
algebra g specifying the 6d N = (2, 0) theory. The mutual non-locality of the surface defects
is captured by a pairing on S6d = bZG, which provides an isomorphism p6d between bZG and

ZG. See table 1 in section 2.1.

On the other hand, for a twisted puncture, the analogous projection map is

and o·α ∈ S6d is obtained by applying the action of the outer-automorphism o on α ∈ S6d. The
co-domain of eπP is S o6d
because the move shown in figure 21 relates a line defect arising at the
end of α ∈ (1− o)·S6d to a line defect arising at the end of a trivial line defect. Thus, modulo
screenings, line defects living on P arising at the ends of surface defects in (1 − o) · S6d are
equivalent to genuine line defects living on P. For future purposes, let us define the projection
map

πo : S6d → S o6d

(4.8)

associated to (4.6).

Moving forwards, we often combine the twisted and untwisted cases by regarding the
untwisted case as a special case of the twisted cases obtained by choosing o to be the identity
element in the outer-automorphism group.

Trapped magnetic lines. Now consider two elements h1, h2 ∈ HP whose image in S o6d
is
the same. Then, h1 − h2 ∈ HP describes a line defect living on P which is not attached to any
bulk surface defect. We call such a line defect as a line defect trapped at the codimension-two
defect (or puncture) P. There is a subgroup HTP ⊆ HP which are trapped line defects. In
total, we have a short exact sequence

0 → HTP → HP → ZP → 0 ,

where the map

in (4.9) is the inclusion map making HTP a subgroup of HP, and

For an untwisted puncture, o is identity and hence S6d,o = S6d. The bulk surface defects
in S6d,o can be wrapped along a loop linking P as the outer-automorphism codimension-one
topological defect associated to o leaves them invariant. Now take a surface defect in S6d,o

P to be the subgroup of genuine
line defects living on P that can be 'lifted' to bulk surface defects of the 6d theory. Thus, we
have a projection map

(4.14)
Before moving forward, notice that the pairing on S6d descends to a pairing between S6d,o and
S o6d
. To show this, we need to show that hα, βi = 0 if α ∈ S6d,o ⊆ S6d and β ∈ (1−o)·S6d ⊆ S6d.

In summary, the defect group associated to a puncture is uniquely determined by the

magnetic data which fits into a nested pair of short exact sequences as

defects living on the codimension-two defect P. The vertical sequence relates surface defects
of the 6d bulk theory.

4.2 Defect Groups of Special Punctures
Regular Punctures. For any regular puncture P, we can rephrase the claims of [31] as
stating that LTP = 0 and YP = S6d,o, which taken together imply that

LP = 0 .

(4.31)

P0 Puncture. Consider 6d N = (2, 0) theory of type g. This theory carries a special
untwisted puncture that we call P0. This puncture has the property that

(4.34)
The P0 puncture is obtained by starting from the maximal untwisted regular puncture, which
carries flavor symmetry g, and then gauging this flavor symmetry by adding 4d N = 2 g vector
multiplet along the codimension-two defect. To show that the defect data of the puncture
obtained after g gauging is as claimed above, we simply notice that squeezing bulk surface
defects onto the maximal untwisted regular puncture leads to flavor Wilson lines valued in

bZG = S6d. This means that, after the gauging, squeezing bulk surface defects onto the P0
puncture leads to gauge Wilson line defects valued in S6d, implying that

Moreover, the full set of electric line defects on P0 puncture is given by

= S6d .

WP0 = S6d .

(4.35)

(4.36)

These two properties reproduce all the other properties claimed above.

P o0 Puncture. Consider 6d N = (2, 0) theory of type g and an outer-automorphism o. Then
we have a special twisted puncture P o0 attached to the outer-automorphism o. This puncture
has the property that

This implies that it has

(4.39)
The P o0 puncture is obtained by starting from the maximal twisted regular puncture associated
to o, which carries flavor symmetry h∨
which is the Langlands dual of the subalgebra12 ho of
non-trivial o, there is an isomorphism between S6d,o and the group bZH∨
g left invariant by the action of o. Let us note that, except for the case of g = su(2n + 1) and
Pontryagin dual to
on g and o, both S6d,o and bZH∨

This flavor symmetry h∨

is then gauged by adding 4d N = 2 h∨

. Now we divide further analysis into two cases:

vector multiplet along
the codimension-two defect. To show that the defect data of the puncture obtained after
h∨
gauging is as claimed above, we simply notice that squeezing bulk surface defects valued
in S6d,o onto the maximal twisted regular puncture leads to flavor Wilson lines valued in
S6d,o ' bZH∨
• For all cases except g = su(2n + 1) and non-trivial o, the flavor Wilson lines in bZH∨
local operators carrying non-trivial flavor center charges valued in bZH∨
are not screened by any genuine local operators, or in other words, there are no genuine
. This means
that, after the gauging, squeezing bulk surface defects onto the P o0 puncture leads to
gauge Wilson line defects valued in S6d,o ' bZH∨

• For the case of g = su(2n + 1) and non-trivial o, the flavor Wilson lines in bZH∨
= Z2 are
screened by genuine local operators [104]. Thus, after gauging, there are no non-trivial
electric line operators (modulo screenings) carried by such a P o0 puncture. This leads to
the properties claimed above.

4.3 Defect Groups of Class S Theories from Defect Groups of Punctures
We now combine the defect groups of punctures discussed in the last subsection together with
the surface defect contributions discussed in [31], to determine the defect group of an arbitrary
class S theory, containing an arbitrary number of twisted and untwisted, irregular and regular
punctures, on an arbitrary genus Riemann surface.

Various types of possible lines. Consider a general compactification of a 6d N = (2, 0)
theory of type g, leading to a 4d N = 2 theory T. Let Pi with i = 1, 2,··· , k label the various
punctures on the compactification manifold Σg of genus g. Additionally, we have an outer-
automorphism background [B] ∈ H1(Σ∗
is the compactification manifold with
punctures removed, and Og is the group of outer-automorphisms of g. Near a puncture Pi,
the background [B] has a holonomy oi ∈ Og around Pi, where oi is the outer-automorphism
element associated to Pi.

We moreover have the line defects living on each Pi that are not attached to any bulk
surface defect. These form the group Y

Finally, we include line defects arising from the bulk surface defects ending on punctures. For
this purpose, we pick a non-self-intersecting path Ci,i+1 from puncture i to puncture i + 1 for
each 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1. We additionally require that there is no intersection between two paths
Ci,i+1 and Cj,j+1 for i 6= j. Let us also define for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k

(4.44)

p=i

More precisely, Ci,j is a path from i to j obtained by taking the Pj−1

p=i Cp,p+1 and perturbing
it slightly away from the punctures i + 1, i + 2,··· , j − 1, so that Ci,j doesn't hit those
punctures. Moreover, let Zi,j be the subgroup of S6d generated by 0 ∈ S6d and non-zero
elements α ∈ Yi,j ⊆ S6d having the property that either πoi

be represented in the vicinity of Ci,j as shown in figure 23.

To describe the third identification, pick punctures 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < i3 ≤ k. Define

Zi1,i2,i3 := Zi1,i2 ∩ Zi2,i3

In particular, the 4d line defect α[Ci] ∈ K is equivalent to trivial line defect for α ∈ YPi

Thus, in total, we find that the defect group of line defects of the 4d N = 2 Class S theory

T is

LT = KT/ ∼

(4.56)

with the identifications ∼ generated by (4.50), (4.51), (4.53) and (4.55).

Pairing on the defect group. The pairing on LT descends from the pairing on KT, which
can be concretely described after choosing a representative co-chain B ∈ C1(Σ∗

outer-automorphism background [B] ∈ H1(Σ∗

from B by applying Poincaré duality. Notice that the chain b ends on each twisted puncture
Pi carrying the element oi in the neighborhood of Pi. We additionally require that b does not
intersect the paths Ci,j.

g,Og). Let b ∈ C1(Σ∗

Picking such a representative allows us to construct elements of K as follows. Pick a non-
self-intersecting loop C and a point p in C. As we traverse the loop C starting from p, we find
that it intersects b at n number of points p1, p2,··· pn. Thus the loop is divided into segments
Ci,i+1 lying between points pi, pi+1. Let b carry the element oi at the intersection point pi.
Then, we obtain an element αp[C] ∈ K by inserting an element α ∈ S6d at point p. The
element α must satisfy on · on−1 ··· o2 · o1 · α = α. The element of S6d inserted at any other
point q along the loop is then determined uniquely in terms of α. Along the segment between
pn and p1, it is α. And along the segment Ci,i+1 it is oi · oi−1 ··· o2 · o1 · α. See figure 24. Such
elements αp[C] for all choices of α, p, C generate via linear combinations the whole of K.

The pairing can now be concretely described as follows:

p, the loop intersects various outer-automorphism twist lines o1, o2,··· , on. The sub-segment
of C between the locations of intersections with oi and oi+1 is called Ci,i+1. Once the element
α ∈ S6d carried by C at point p is specified, the element carried by the sub-segment Ci,i+1 is
fixed to be oi · oi−1 ··· o2 · o1 · α.

• There is a self-pairing on the K subfactor of KT provided by combining the pairing on
S6d with the intersection pairing on H1(Σg, Z). More concretely, consider two elements
αp[C], βq[D] ∈ K. Let C and D intersect at points r1, r2,··· , rm. Let αri
be
the elements of S6d carried by αp[C] and βq[D] respectively at the point ri. Then the
pairing can be described as

Such a 4d theory is relative and has a defect group that we discussed in detail above in this
subsection. An absolute 4d N = 2 Class S theory TΛ can be chosen from this relative Class
S theory T by choosing a polarization Λ, which is a maximal subgroup of LT on which the

5 Computing Defect Groups of Punctures
5.1 Special Class S Theories Associated to a Puncture
In the previous section we discussed how the defect group of a Class S theory can be computed
in terms of defect groups of punctures participating in the compactification. In this subsection,
we discuss how the defect group of a puncture can be computed in terms of the defect groups

44

associated to some special Class S theories whose construction involves the puncture under
consideration.
If an alternative way of computing the defect groups of the special Class S
theories is known, then one obtains the defect group associated to the puncture. We will
discuss such alternative ways in subsequent sections.

Computing the trapped defect group. Consider an untwisted puncture P of 6d N =
(2, 0) theory of type g. Our first claim is that the trapped defect group LTP associated to P is
obtained as the defect group of line defects of the 4d N = 2 Class S theory TP obtained by
compactifying the 6d N = (2, 0) theory on a sphere carrying only a single puncture, with the
puncture being of type P. Let us compute the defect group of this Class S theory TP using
the formalism developed in the previous section. First of all, we have

g,S6d) = 0 .
Moreover, since we have a single puncture P, we can write

K = H1(Σ∗

The loop Ci linking Pi is homologically trivial. So the identification (4.55) imposes that

KTP = HTP × WP .
bZP 3 α ∼ 0 ∈ LTP .

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

Modding out by this identification, we find that the defect group of this Class S theory is

LTP = eLTP / ∼ = HTP × W TP = LTP

(5.4)

as claimed above.

Note that if we add untwisted regular punctures on the sphere, then the defect group of
the resulting Class S theory is also LTP. In particular, we will often consider the Class S theory
P obtained by compactifying N = (2, 0) theory on a sphere containing a single puncture of
T∗
type P and a single untwisted maximal regular puncture, for computing LTP via

LT∗
P

= LTP .

(5.5)

For a twisted puncture P, we define TP to be the 4d N = 2 Class S theory obtained by
compactifying 6d (2, 0) theory on a sphere with two punctures: one of them being of type P,
and the other being a minimal regular twisted puncture. One can easily show, in a similar
fashion as above, that

LTP = LTP .

45

(5.6)

We can replace the minimal regular twisted puncture by any other regular twisted puncture,
and the defect group of the resulting Class S theory is also LTP. In particular, we will often
consider the Class S theory T∗
P obtained by replacing the minimal regular twisted puncture
by a maximal regular twisted puncture, for computing LTP via

LT∗
P

= LTP .

(5.7)

Computing the full defect group. Our second claim is that LP for a puncture P asso-
P o0P obtained by
ciated to outer-automorphism o−1 is the defect group of the Class S theory T
considering compactification of (2, 0) theory on a sphere with a single puncture Pi of type P

5.2 Generalized Quivers: Classes GQ and GQ0
We will conjecture (and in some cases argue) that the defect groups of lines associated to a
large class of (conformal and non-conformal) punctures can be computed as the defect groups
of lines of generalized quiver gauge theories lying in a subclass GQ of all 4d N = 2 generalized
quiver gauge theories.

τ ∈ GQ takes the following form

where gi are gauge algebras for 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1 and gk is a flavor algebra. Moreover, we have

(5.18)

where h∨
is the Langlands dual to the subalgebra ho of the 6d A,D,E algebra g left invariant by
the outer-automorphism o associated to the puncture under study. Each edge Mi for 1 ≤ i ≤ k

o

47

denotes a 4d N = 2 'matter' SCFT whose flavor algebra is gauged by the neighboring gauge
algebra nodes.

Then, the conjecture states that there is a large family Fτ of o-twisted punctures of 6d
N = (2, 0) theory of type g such that the defect group associated to a puncture P ∈ Fτ is the
same as the defect group associated to τ

LP = Lτ .

gauge center charges of non-genuine local operators arising from Mi span a sub-lattice

Let

Then, we can write the defect group of lines of the quiver theory τ as

5.3 Spectral Cover Monodromies and ALE Fibrations in IIB
We will now discuss how the part L0P of the full defect group, as defined in (4.29), can be
easily computed using the monodromy of the Hitchin field φ as one encircles the puncture P.
Note that the information about L0P is insufficient in providing the full information about LP.

Higgs field for a general Class S compactification. The Higgs field φ of a relative
theory of class S with bulk Lie algebra g and UV curve C is a g valued meromorphic section of
the canonical bundle KC modulo gauge transformations. We consider Higgs fields which are
globally diagonalizable by some gauge transformation, that is their profile lies along a Cartan
subalgebra h ⊂ g. Gauge transformations bringing Higgs fields into this diagonal form are
fixed up to conjugation by elements in the Weyl group wg which maps h onto itself. The Higgs
field is therefore a meromorphic section of KC ⊗ (h/wg).

The spectral curve of a Higgs field φ with respect to a representation r of g is13

Σr = {(z, λz) ∈ KC  det(λz − φr(z)) = 0} ⊂ KC ,

(5.48)

where φr is the presentation of the Higgs field φ as acting on r. Denote the dimension of the
representation by dim r = r, then the spectral curve Σr is a ramified r-fold covering of C away
from the poles of φr. The r sheets of the covering are permuted by Weyl transformations
when encircling untwisted punctures and branch points and by outer automorphisms Og when
crossing twist lines.

Higgs field in a generic small open set. Consider the spectral curve Σr restricted to
a local patch U ⊂ C away from punctures, branch points and twist lines. Across U the
sheets of Σr can be distinguished and labelled by weights of r and the Higgs field φ lifts to a
meromorphic section of KU ⊗ h. The weights of the representation r are r elements in the dual
space h∗ of the Cartan subalgebra h and we denote these by wi with i = 1, . . . , r. To label
the sheets of Σr across U we consider the canonical Weyl-invariant pairing (· ,· ) : h∗ ⊗ h → C
and define

λz,i = xi(z)dz = (wi, φ(z)) ,

(5.49)
which gives precisely r solutions (sheets) to the spectral equation det(λz − φr(z)) = 0. Given
gauge equivalent Higgs fields as sections in KC ⊗ h their labelling of sheets by weights are
related by Weyl transformations. There are wg equivalent labelings of spectral cover sheets
by weights.

Higgs field near a puncture and monodromy. Next consider the spectral curve Σr
restricted to a local patch V ⊂ C containing a single puncture P. Choose complex coordinate
t centered on the puncture and coordinate v on the cotangent fiber such that λi = vidt/t
which will prove convenient later in relation to IIA Hanay-Witten brane constructions. In a
subset U ⊂ V we can label the sheets vi by weights wi. Encircling P the sheets and weights

are permuted by a Weyl transformation and possibly an outer-automorphism if the puncture
is twisted. This gives a monodromy action on the weight lattice Λweight. The weight lattice
contains the root lattice Λroot ⊂ Λweight and therefore the monodromy lifts to an action on
the root lattice. We obtain a monodromy action MP of the puncture P on the root lattice of
the bulk algebra g

MP : Λroot → Λroot .

(5.50)
This monodromy action can be read off from any spectral curve Σr for which the weight system
of the representation r spans Λweight or equivalently that contains the set of fundamental
weights. For Lie algebras g = An−1, Dn≥4, E6, E7 the lowest-dimensional representations with
this property are the n-dimensional fundamental representation, the 2n-dimensional vector
representation and the representations 27, 56 respectively.

ALE-fibration in Type IIB. We discuss the physical consequences of the monodromy
action MP in the IIB dual description where the above configurations are recast in a purely
geometric framework. In this picture the Higgs field is the period map for the ALE fibration

(cid:94)C2/Γg ,→ X0

3 → V 0 ,

(5.51)
3. Here (cid:94)C2/Γg
with respect to the holomorphic top form Ω of the Calabi-Yau three-fold X0
denotes the hyperkahler unfolding of the ADE singularity C2/Γg to an ALE space and V 0
denotes V with the puncture P at t = 0 excised. The ALE fibration degenerates approaching
the puncture. We obtain a non-degenerate ALE fibration by restricting to V ∗ which is defined
as V with an open disk containing t = 0 removed. The geometry modelling each puncture is

(cid:94)C2/Γg ,→ X3 → V ∗ .

The boundary of this geometry has two components BP and BX. These are fibered as

(cid:94)C2/Γg ,→ BP → S1
S3/Γg ,→ BX → V ∗ .

(5.52)

(5.53)

Here S1 bounds the open disk excised from V . See figure 25. The two five-dimensional
boundary components intersect along a four-dimensional corner BX ∩ BP = ∂BP which is
fibered as

(5.54)
We are interested in the torsional two-cycles of the boundary components BP and BX which
can arise as the intersection of non-compact three-cycles in the full IIB ALE fibration. D3

branes wrapping such three-cycles engineer line defects. Both boundary components con-
tribute to the spectrum of such two-cycles.

We begin by considering BX which is fibered over V ∗. The base V ∗ is topologically an
annulus and deformation retracts onto a circle. The homology groups of BX therefore follow
H1(S3/Γg, Z) ∼= bZG
from the monodromy action on Hk(S3/Γg, Z). A non-trivial monodromy can only occur for
∼= Λweights/Λroots. The monodromy action on H1(S3/Γg, Z) can therefore

be inferred from the action on weights and we find it to be trivial, this implies

H2(BX , Z) ∼= Γab

g

∼= bZG .

(5.55)

Here, the superscript ab denotes the abelianization of the group.

Next consider BP. Its ALE fibers contain rank g rational curves. These rational curves
decompactify when S1 shrinks onto the puncture. Therefore, any three-cycle in the IIB ALE
fibration which intersects BP in such a rational curve is in fact non-compact. The monodromy
action associated with the puncture introduces redundancies among these rational curves with
independent classes counted by H2(BP , Z). According to the results of [13], the contribution
of the boundary component BP to the defect group LP takes the form Tor H2(BP , Z). The
rational curves are associated with the simple roots of the Lie algebra g by the McKay corre-
spondence. The monodromy action on rational curves is therefore the one described in (5.50)
which is now geometrized as

MP : H2((cid:94)C2/Γg, Z) → H2((cid:94)C2/Γg, Z) .

(5.56)

As all smooth manifolds fibered over a circle the homology groups of BP are determined by
the monodromy mappings

Mk : Hk((cid:94)C2/Γg, Z) → Hk((cid:94)C2/Γg, Z) ,

(5.57)

which enter into the short exact sequence

0 → coker (Mk − 1) → Hk(BP , Z) → ker (Mk−1 − 1) → 0 .

(5.58)

54

Of these mappings only M2 ≡ MP differs from the identity. With this we derive

Tor H2(BP , Z) ∼= Tor coker (MP − 1) .

Upon checking against predictions for defect groups via other methods, we find that

Tor coker (MP − 1) ∼= L0P = WP × HTP .

Notice that all trapped contributions are accounted for.

(5.59)

(5.60)

Finally we require a map from the boundary component BX into the total boundary ∂X

which determines the projection H2(BX , Z) ∼= bZG onto bZP. The cycles in the image of this
map are expected to link with the cycles associated to L0P defining a Dirac pairing from which
dual pairing between bL0P = HP × W TP and ZP. The elements of bL0P that have trivial pairing
the full data of the puncture (4.30) can be derived as follows. The pairing defines a Pontryagin
with all the elements of ZP form the subgroup LTP = HTP × W TP . From this we can determine
(5.61)

HTP =qLTP

and we obtain the injection

iP : HTP → HP

(5.62)
allowing us to determine all the relevant data about the full defect group LP of the puncture
P.
When discussing the ALE-fibration, we will in the following restrict our attention only
to L0P, while leaving the geometric determination of the above-mentioned projection map
bZG → bZP to future work. Morally, this projection map is the geometric avatar of the squeezing

map (4.14).

6 Type IIB on Canonical Singularities and Irregular Punctures

There is a special class of punctures (that we refer to as IHS punctures) for which the 4d
N = 2 theory TP defined in section 5.1 can be constructed as IIB compactified on an isolated
hypersurface singularity (IHS). This provides a map between IHS singularities and irregular
punctures of IHS type. The subsection 6.1 discusses this map for untwisted irregular punctures
of IHS type, which is quite well-known in the literature. The following subsections 6.2 -- 6.4
discuss the map for twisted irregular punctures. Some of the twisted cases have been discussed
in prior literature, while some others are being discussed for the first time. Using the IHS
description presented here, we can compute the defect groups LTP associated to the theories
TP, which as discussed in section 5.1, coincide with the trapped parts LTP of the defect groups

55

LP associated to the IHS punctures P. Thus the IIB IHS description provides a concrete
and simple way of computing the trapped defect groups of IHS punctures, which can be
used as strong counter-checks for the various proposals regarding the defect groups of general
punctures made in this paper.

Finally, in subsection 6.5, we discuss another class of IHS singularities that have the
property that compactifying IIB on such IHS singularities leads to 4d N = 2 "trinion" SCFTs
that are obtained by gauging a diagonal flavor symmetry of three T∗
(with i = 1, 2, 3) theories,
Pi
where Pi are IHS punctures. Thus, one can compute the defect groups of these trinion theories
using the IHS techniques. On the other hand, as discussed in this subsection, the same defect
group can also be expressed in terms of the defect groups LPi
associated to the punctures
Pi. It turns out that the defect group of the trinion theory sees not only the trapped parts
LTPi
, but also some of the non-trapped parts. Thus, matching the defect group of
trinion theories as obtained using IHS, against the defect groups predicted using our proposal,
provides strong checks for the proposed non-trapped parts of the defect groups of punctures.

6.1 Untwisted Punctures
Let us begin the discussion by considering untwisted irregular punctures discussed in [81,88].
Such punctures are characterized by two integers k, b, where k takes infinitely many values,
while b takes either two or three possible values. We call such punctures IHS punctures. This
is because the 4d N = 2 Class S theory TP, obtained by compactifying the 6d (2, 0) theory
on a sphere with a single puncture P, can be constructed by compactifying Type IIB on an
IHS singularity, for almost all punctures P discussed in [81,88], except for the punctures with
extremely small values of k.

The defining equation is given by an ADE singularity, of the same type as the 6d N =
(2, 0) theory relevant for the Class S realization, fibered over a complex plane. This is not
surprising since 6d N = (2, 0) theories are engineered in Type IIB by compactification on the
corresponding ADE singularity and the complex plane parametrizes the punctured sphere,
with the puncture located at infinity. The defining equation for the IHS is

P(x1, x2, x3, z) = x2

1 + F(x2, x3, z) = 0
Ω3 = dx1 ∧ dx2 ∧ dx3 ∧ dz

dP

,

(6.1)

where we use the coordinate z to parametrize the sphere and Ω3 denotes the holomorphic
three-form.

We now summarize briefly the properties and types of such IHS punctures. Concerning
untwisted irregular punctures, we are interested in the case when the Higgs field for a 6d (2, 0)

Table 2: Untwisted irregular punctures of IHS type and their hypersurface realization. We
provide the hypersurface equations in C4, which correspond to class S theories with one irreg-
ular puncture of type (G, b, k). Note that in order for the IHS to be well-defined k needs to be
large enough. The Type indicates the description of the singularity in KS-YY classification of
IHS (see [55] for our conventions).

(6.2)

The values of (G, k, b) are constrained and lead to the hypersurfaces in table 2, as was discussed
in [82]. In table 2 we also provide the identifications with AD theories when appropriate.

We will also consider the closely-related family of theories T∗

P whose class S description is
in terms of a sphere with one irregular puncture P of type IHS and a full regular puncture.
Also these have a Type IIB description since they can be realized as hypersurfaces in C3 × C∗.
The defining equations are essentially the same as in table 2. The only difference is that the
coordinate z is now C∗-valued (and accordingly we replace dz with d(logz) in Ω3) and the
parameter k should be replaced by k + b (see [105]). Said differently, we see that geometrically
closing the regular puncture amounts to shifting k → k−b. Note that k has to be large enough
for the equation in table 2 to be regular. In the class S description this corresponds to the
fact that unless k is large enough, the full regular puncture cannot be closed [105].

6.2 Twisted Punctures
The situation is more subtle in the case of twisted punctures since the twist line must neces-
sarily end at a second puncture, invalidating the above argment. We will however find that,
once the second puncture is taken to be regular and minimal, the resulting SCFT can still be

Table 3: Twisted irregular punctures of IHS type: In the fourth column the relevant hy-
persurface singularity in C4 is provided and in the last column we report the corresponding
singularity type according to the KS-YY classification (see [55] for our conventions). Entries
in red are those already identified in [106]. In the first column we provide the corresponding
6d N = (2, 0) theory and in the second column we indicate the outer-automorphism twist
considered.

described by a IHS. In order to derive this statement, we start from the theory with a twisted
full puncture whose Type IIB geometric description in terms of a hypersurface in C3 × C∗ is
known explicitly [89].

Our strategy is to show that upon closure of the regular puncture we find a model which
admits a IHS description in Type IIB. We provide the corresponding equations in the fourth
column of table 3. Furthermore, in the last column of the table we include the singularity
type in the notation of [55].

The defining equation of the hypersurface is derived as follows: We assume that, as in the
untwisted case, the singularity is of the form u2 + F(x, y, z) = 0 and then we determine the
explicit form of F by matching the Coulomb Branch (CB) spectra of the two theories. This
will now be exemplified for a few twisted irregular punctures.

Before entering the details of the derivation, let us remind the reader how to determine
CB operators and physical parameters of a N = 2 SCFT geometrically engineered in Type
IIB string theory. The procedure exploits the fact that (extended) CB moduli are associated
with complex structure deformations of the geometry and therefore what we need to do is to
deform the hypersurface singularity and determine the scaling dimension of the corresponding

58

parameters. This information is extracted via the following procedure [78]:

1. We impose the normalization condition that the holomorphic three-form Ω3 has dimen-
sion one. This must be required since its periods compute the mass of BPS states in the
theory.

2. We require that all the terms appearing in the equation describing the deformed singu-

larity have the same dimension.

Once we have the full list of parameters together with their scaling dimension is known, we can
exploit the rule that parameters whose dimension is smaller than one correspond to coupling
constants of the theory, those with dimension exactly one are mass parameters and those with
dimension larger than one describe the expectation value of Coulomb branch operators14. We
therefore see that we can extract the CB spectrum of the theory with this method.

6.3 Extracting the IHS for twisted A3
Since the procedure is rather involved, let us start by illustrating our method with a specific
example, namely a A3 twisted theory described by the Type IIB geometry

W(u, v, x, z) ≡ uv + x4 + zκ + subleading = 0; Ω3 = du ∧ dv ∧ dx ∧ dz

.

(6.3)

zdW

The subleading terms encode all the physical parameters of the theory and can be uniformly
described as z-dependent versal deformations of the ADE singularity (in this case A3). When
the corresponding Casimir is invariant under the action of the outer-automorphism, the sub-
leading terms are proportional to integer powers of z; otherwise they are proportional to a
fractional (half-integer in all cases apart from Z3 twisted D4) power of z.
In the case at
hand the Casimirs of degree 2 and 4 lead therefore to terms of the form x2z2u2,n and znu4,n
respectively, whose scaling dimensions are
D(u2,n) = 2 − n

from (6.3). The cubic Casimir instead leads to terms of the form xzn−1/2u3,n and their
dimension is

D(u3,n) = 3 −

(6.5)
From (6.3) we see that allowing all terms with n a positive integer, the degree k differentials
appearing in the spectral curve have at z = 0 a pole of order 1, 5
2 , 3 for k = 2, 3, 4 respectively.
14There is potentially an exception to this rule in the case of hypersurfaces in C3×C∗, since some parameters
with dimension larger than one might actually correspond to mass parameters rather than CB operators. These
can be singled out by looking at the behaviour of Ω3, since residues for the holomorphic three-form always
correspond to mass parameters and not CB operators, regardless of their dimension.

κ

59

The leading singular terms are those with n = 0. Let us now explain how the spectrum
changes upon closure of the regular puncture.

Since for a minimal twisted puncture the pole degrees of the k-differentials are reduced to
1, 1
2 , 2 (see [71]), we conclude that we need to remove u3,1, u3,2 and u4,1. This is not the end of
the story though, since we also need to take into account constraints: It is known that for each
k-differential a puncture can introduce a constraint which can be either of a-type or of c-type.
The latter says that the leading singular term is actually the product of other terms appearing
in the spectral curve, therefore reducing by one the number of independent parameters. A
constraint of a-type instead tells us that the leading term is the square of a more fundamental
object. Full punctures never exhibit constraints however, a minimal twisted A3 puncture has a
c-constraint for k = 4. This tells us that u4,2 is not an independent operator and therefore we
can discard it from the spectrum of the theory. If it had been a constraint of type a we should
have replaced u4,2, whose dimension is 4 − 8/κ, with another of dimension 2 − 4/κ. Overall,
upon closure of the puncture we find the following spectrum from the quadratic differential

and from cubic and quartic differentials

(n ≥ 3).

(6.6)

(6.7)

As we have explained before, parameters with dimension larger than one are Coulomb branch
operators, those with dimension exactly one are mass parameters and the others are coupling
constants.

From these data we will now try to guess the IHS equation, assuming, as we have mentioned

before, that the general structure is

W(u, x, y, z) ≡ u2 + F(x, y, z) = 0; Ω3 = du ∧ dx ∧ dy ∧ dz

dW

.

(6.8)

A useful observation at this stage is that the CB operator of largest dimension is u4,3. Since
for a singularity of the form (6.8) a constant term (i.e. which does not depend on any of the
four coordinates) is always an allowed deformation and the corresponding parameter is clearly
the CB operator of highest dimension, we identify it with u4,3 and therefore we conclude that
D(u) = D(u4,3)
. We can also notice that the parameters coming from a given k-
differential have scaling dimension spaced by 4/m and therefore it is natural to guess that one
of the coordinates (say x) has precisely that dimension. We can further guess the dimension
of y by noticing that D(u4,n) − D(u3,n) = D(u3,n) − D(u2,n−2) for every n and therefore
the most natural option is that the corresponding terms in the IHS equation are obtained

κ

by gradully increasing the power of one of the coordinates, whose dimension is therefore
necessarily D(u4,n) − D(u3,n) = 1 − 2
. Now that we have a guess for the scaling dimension of
all the coordinates except z, we can notice that requiring Ω3 to have dimension one we find
the equation

D(x) + D(y) + D(z) = 1 + D(u),

(6.9)
from which we conclude that D(z) = 2 − 8
. The last step is to construct a homogeneous
singularity of the form (6.8) compatible with our prediction for the scaling dimensions. We
find that

κ

(6.10)
does the job. We can indeed check that the spectrum derived from this IHS reproduces (6.6)
and (6.7). We therefore recover the result reported in Table 3.

6.4 IHS for twisted irregular punctures
The strategy we will follow to identify the IHS equations is to implement for all cases the
analysis presented in 6.3 for the A3 case. We will now review for each case the relevant
properties of twisted punctures and then explain how to construct the relevant IHS singularity.
We have checked in all cases that the CB spectrum of the IHS reproduces that of the class S
theory on the sphere with minimal and irregular twisted punctures.

6.4.1 Twisted Aodd theories
In this case all Casimirs of odd degree change sign under the action of the outer-automorphism,
therefore all the k-differentials with k odd are proportional to half-integer powers of z and
those with k even are proportional to integer powers of z. The properties of twisted Aodd
regular punctures were derived in [71]. The full puncture introduces at z = 0 poles of order
(6.11)
where b c denotes the integer part. It turns out that there are no a-type constraints for the
minimal twisted puncture. Since we are only interested in determining the spectrum of the
theory, we can directly consider the combined effect of c-type constraints and the different
pole orders. Overall, the order of poles minus the number of c-constraints is

and generalizes the A3 family we have discussed before. As in 6.3 we expect in the IHS
one coordinate with dimension 2N
since this is the spacing between operators from each k-
κ
differential. We also expect a second coordinate which allows us to go e.g.
from the CB
operator of largest dimension in φk to the one in φk−1. This has dimension 1 − N
. Finally,
since ∆max (the highest dimension in the CB spectrum) after closure becomes 2N− 2N2+2N
we
conclude that the third coordinate has dimension N − N2+N
. Finally, using the normalization
condition D(Ω3) = 1 we find that the fourth coordinate has dimension N − N2+2N
. Using
these data we find as desired the IHS singularity

(6.15)

The spacing between operators from the same k-differential is always a multiple of 4N−2
2κ+1 and
this quantity will therefore become the dimension of one of the coordinates.
Interpolating
between differentials of degree k and k − 1 requires instead a coordinate with dimension
1 − 2N−1
2κ+1 . The coordinate u will have dimension ∆max/2, which in the case at hand is equal
to N − (2N−1)(N+1)
. Finally, the normalization condition D(Ω3) = 1 implies that the fourth
coordinate has dimension N − (2N−1)(N+2)

. From these results we find the IHS

u2 + xyκ−N + yz2 + zxN = 0.

(6.16)

6.4.2 Twisted Aeven theories
Also in this case the outer-automorphism changes the sign of k-differentials with k odd. The
corresponding monomials will therefore involve half-integer powers of the coordinate z. Un-
fortunately the detailed data of twisted Aeven punctures are not known at present, but we
have sufficient information to determine how the spectrum changes upon closure of the regu-
lar puncture [106]. The change in pole orders and the implementation of c-type constraints15

instructs us to remove for each k-differential the j k

k − 1 terms with largest dimension from

the spectrum of the theory with a full puncture. Furthermore, there is a constraint of a-type
whenever k is odd and therefore we should modify the spectrum accordingly.
15It is not known at present how to disentangle these two pieces of information.

Let us give an example of this procedure since this is the first time we come across a-type
constraints. Let us consider the case k = 5 (and bt = 2N for definiteness). The corresponding
operators in the theory with a full puncture have dimension

k−1 is 1 for k = 5, in order to implement the closure we first remove the operator with

6.4.3 Twisted DN+1 theories
The class S description includes k-differentials with k even from 2 to 2N plus another dif-
ferential with k = N + 1 associated with the pfaffian of the Hitchin field. For this family

63

of theories the outer-automorphism acts nontrivially (changing the sign) of the pfaffian only.
The corresponding monomials will therefore involve half-integer powers of the coordinate z. In
this case both the full and minimal punctures do not exhibit any constraints [69] and therefore
we just need to know the pole orders. For the differentials (φ2, φ4, . . . , φ2N; φN+1) the pole
orders for the full puncture are (1, 3, . . . , 2N − 1; 2N+1
) whereas for the minimal puncture we

6.4.4 Z3-twisted D4 theories
This is the only case in which the outer-automorphism is not Z2. There are a quadratic and a
sextic differentials which are invariant under outer-automorphisms and two quartic differentials
which transform as φ4 → ωφ4 and φ4 → ω−1 φ4 with ω3 = 1. This implies that all terms in

64

φ2 and φ6 contain integer powers of z, whereas φ4 contains terms of the form zn+1/3 and φ4
contains terms of the form zn+2/3. The pole orders (see [63]) for (φ2, φ4, φ4, φ6) at the full
puncture are (1, 10/3, 11/3, 5) and at the minimal puncture are (1, 7/3, 8/3, 4). In the case of
the minimal puncture we have a constraint of a-type for φ4 and a c-constraint for φ4. There
are instead two constraints of c-type for φ6.

Models with bt = 12. The relevant SW geometry is

3κ±1, which

becomes the dimension of one of the coordinates. The new feature in this case is that the sign
ambiguity leads to two different families of singularities. Moving between the differentials φ6
3κ±1 and going instead from φ6 to φ4 leads to
and φ4 requires a coordinate with dimension 2− 20
a coordinate with dimension 2− 16
3κ±1. The coordinate u has as always dimension ∆max/2, i.e.
3 − 24
3κ±1. Notice that at this stage we have already determined the scaling dimensions of all
the coordinates and therefore the normalization condition D(Ω3) = 1 should be automatically
satisfied for the consistency of our picture. It is satisfactory to see this is indeed the case.
From these assignments of dimensions we find the following two families of singularities:

when we choose the + sign and

when we choose the − sign.

u2 + x3 + yz3 + zyκ−2 = 0

u2 + x3 + yz3 + xyκ−3 = 0

Models with bt = 6. The relevant SW geometry is

(6.27)

(6.28)

u2 + x3 + xy2 + zκ + subleading = 0.

We have no sign ambiguity this time, but as in the bt = 12 case we will be able to identify
the scaling dimension of all the coordinates without exploiting the normalization condition.
The spacing between operators from the same k-differential is a multiple of 6
, which therefore
becomes the dimension of one of the coordinates. Moving between the differentials φ6 and
and going instead from φ6 to φ4 leads to a

6.4.5 Twisted E6 theories
In the E6 class S theory we have k-differentials with k = 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12 and only those with
k = 5, 9 are odd under the action of the outer-automorphism. We therefore conclude that
terms in φ5 and φ9 are proportional to half-integer powers of z whereas all the others are
proportional to integer powers of z. Finally, let us consider the properties of the full and
minimal punctures [66]. The pole orders for (φ2, φ5, φ6, φ8, φ9, φ12) are (1, 9/2, 5, 7, 17/2, 11)
for the full puncture and (1, 5/2, 3, 4, 9/2, 6) for the minimal. Moreover, the minimal puncture
exhibits one constraint of a-type for φ6 and several c-type constraints: one for φ5, two for φ8
and φ9 and three for φ12.

Models with bt = 18. The relevant SW geometry is

u2 + x3 + y4 + yzκ+1/2 + subleading = 0.

(6.31)

The spacing between operators from the same k-differential is a multiple of

2κ+1. Finally, in this case ∆max = 12 − 162
leads to a coordinate with dimension 4 − 54
2κ+1 and
therefore the dimension of u is equal to 6− 81
2κ+1. Again the normalization condition D(Ω3) = 1
is automatically satisfied. From these assignments of dimensions we find the singularity

u2 + x3 + yz4 + zyκ−6 = 0.

6.5 IHS for Trinions
As is well known, the class S formalism does not allow to describe the gauging of more
than two matter sectors, in particular it does not provide a realization of unitary quivers
with exceptional shape. This is not a restriction for geometric engineering and indeed IHS
descriptions in Type IIB for quivers with exceptional shape are known [76]. This is just a
special case of systems (which we call trinions) involving the gauging of three Db
(G) theories
through a G vector multiplet.

p

A general procedure to construct IHS descriptions for trinions of Db

(G) theories with G
simply-laced was proposed in [29], and we will now briefly review it. With this result at hand,
we can use the Type IIB description to determine the defect group of the trinion theory,
therefore providing a highly nontrivial check of our results. Notice that this computation is
sensitive to the non trapped part of the defect group.

(6.38)

Importantly, if the singularity W = 0 is non-isolated, one needs to add marginal terms to (6.37)
in order to have an isolated singularity at the origin, so that the LG model is well-defined
(see [29] for a detailed discussion on this point).

We will focus on the special case in which the LG model is equivalent to a system with
at most four fields, since this is the class of theories for which the LG superpotential reduces
to the defining equation of a IHS. This is always the case when G is special unitary since
WG = w2 + t2 + xN and therefore also t is massive and can be integrated out, leaving us
with the four fields x, z1, z2, z3. We then conclude that a trinion involving the gauging of
Dbi

(SU(N)) for i = 1, 2, 3 is described by the IHS
1 + xN−b2zp2

xN + xN−b1zp1

2 + xN−b3zp3

3 = 0 .

(6.39)

The case in which G is special orthogonal or exceptional is more subtle since we cannot
integrate out either t or x. In order to reduce to a system with four fields, we should restrict
to cases in which at least one of the fields zi is massive, so that it can be integrated out. This
happens whenever

zpfb(x, t) = z2

(6.40)
for p = 2 or p = 1 and an appropriate choice of b. Such massive fields can be integrated out.
If we choose p = 2 for one of the legs, we are considering a trinion of the form

(G) sectors should satisfy the relation

(6.42)

Since we are now left with only four fields, the system can be understood as a threefold
compactification in Type IIB. The second option is p = 1, which gives a mass term (6.40) for
b 6= h∨(G), since in that case the fb(x, t) function is always linear in either x or t, we can

associated to the punctures Pi. This is easily found to be

LP1,P2,P3 = HP1,P2,P3 × bHP1,P2,P3

and the pairing provided by the pairing of bHP1,P2,P3 with HP1,P2,P3. In fact, we find that
for all the trinions that can be realized by IHS, the short exact sequence (4.9) splits for each
participating puncture Pi, which allows us to simplify HP1,P2,P3 as

7 Untwisted A

In this section, we describe the first of our proposals for the defect groups associated to
punctures. We discuss untwisted punctures of 6d A-type (2, 0) theories. The key information
that we use about these punctures is discussed in subsection 7.1. We not only consider
conformal punctures of IHS type, but also numerous other classes of conformal punctures. We
also include numerous classes of non-conformal punctures.

In subsection 7.2, we make our proposal. For each puncture, we assign a 4d N = 2
quiver gauge theory, and propose that the defect groups associated to the quiver gauge theory
capture the defect groups of the associated punctures. See section 5.2. Using this proposal,
we explicitly computed the defect groups associated to all punctures considered in subsection
7.1. As a result of this proposal, untwisted punctures of A-type do not carry any trapped
1-form symmetries (but can carry non-trapped parts).

In subsection 7.3, we expand on our motivation for making the proposal discussed in
subsection 7.2. We describe a large sub-class of punctures that admits constructions in terms
of Hanany-Witten brane setups in IIA. The IIA construction implies that, for a puncture P
in this subclass, the 4d N = 2 theory TP0P associated to P is precisely the quiver gauge theory
assigned to P. Hence, the defect group LP of the puncture P must match the defect group of
the quiver theory.

In subsection 7.4, we provide a very strong check of our proposal. We compactify the 4d
N = 2 theory TP0P for an arbitrary puncture P on a circle, which leads us to a quiver gauge
theory in 3d. The defect group of TP0P must now match the defect group of the 3d quiver
theory, and we show that the latter defect group matches the defect group of 4d quiver theory
associated to P.

In subsection 7.5, we use the IIB ALE fibration construction of an arbitrary puncture P
to compute the genuine part L0P of the defect group LP associated to P. In subsection 7.6,
we use the IHS realization to compute the trapped defect groups of IHS punctures, and find
that there cannot be any trapped contribution, which is in line with our proposal. The 4d
N = 2 theories constructed by the IHS include the well-studied (A,A) type Argyres-Douglas
theories, which are known to have trivial 1-form symmetry.

7.1 Punctures
In this section, we discuss untwisted punctures of An−1 N = (2, 0) theory. For simplicity and
uniformity of presentation, we will specify them using a u(n) valued Higgs field, from which
the su(n) Higgs field can be obtained by removing the center of mass. Place the puncture

70

at t = 0 on a complex plane C with coordinate t. Near the puncture, the Higgs field can be
decomposed into blocks, which we label as Bi. Each block Bi is singular at t = 0, with the
leading singular piece being

(7.1)
where Ai is a non-singular diagonal matrix and ri ≥ 0 is a rational number. We order the
blocks such that ri ≥ ri+1. Let s be biggest value of i for which ri > 0. For each i ≤ s, we
write

Ai + ···

Bi = 1
t1+ri

(7.2)
where 1 ≤ qi ≤ n and gcd(pi, qi) = 1. For such a block, the sheets comprising the block are
permuted by a Zqi

monodromy as one encircles the puncture.

ri = pi
qi

It is known [88] that irregular punctures (which in our notation are characterized as the
punctures having s > 0) lead to 4d N = 2 conformal theories only if the compactification
manifold is a sphere and if the sphere carries either a single puncture that is irregular or two
punctures such that one is irregular and the other is regular. However, not every irregular
puncture can be used in this way to obtain a superconformal theory in 4d. Let us call the
irregular punctures that lead to superconformal theories as conformal punctures.

Extending the arguments of [88], we propose that an untwisted A-type puncture P is
conformal only if ri = rj for all i, j ∈ {1, 2,··· , s}. These have 0 ≤ ns ≤ n/2. Out of these,
the IHS punctures discussed in [81,88] are the ones for which ns = 0, 1.

7.5 Spectral Cover Monodromies
In this subsection, we derive the defect group (7.6) of an arbitrary untwisted A-type puncture
using the monodromy of the Higgs field near the puncture, under the assumption that the
puncture does not carry any trapped part. As discussed earlier, the monodromy of the Higgs
field allows one to compute the part

L0P = HTP × WP ⊆ LP

73

(7.17)

of the defect group LP associated to a puncture P.
If one knows via other methods that
HTP = 0, then the whole defect group LP can be recovered from the knowledge of the piece
L0P as then one has the relationship
(cid:17)2
LP =(cid:16)L0P
Notice that in this situation we also have L0P ∼= bZP

For this computation, we only need the profile of the spectral curve near the puncture
placed at t = 0. We work in the frame where the differential associated to the curve is taken
to be λ = vdt/t. Then, the profile of the spectral curve very close to the puncture can be
described as

vn + sX

where

i=1

This is just the leading behavior of the spectral curve following from the Higgs field singularity
(7.1) describing the puncture.

The sheets of the spectral cover form s number of orbits17 (under monodromy around the
puncture) parametrized by the index i. The number of sheets in the orbit i are qi. This means
that the integers pi do not enter the monodromy, and hence the defect group associated to
the puncture. Indeed the result (7.6) depends only on qi but not on pi.

Let ea with 1 ≤ a ≤ n denote various sheets. The first q1 sheets are cyclically permuted
amongst themselves, the next q2 sheets are cyclically permuted amongst themselves, and so
on. The roots can be expressed as

(7.21)
for 1 ≤ a ≤ n − 1. The above monodromy action on the sheets ea descends to a monodromy
action MP on the roots αa. We now compute and find if ns = 0

αa = ea − ea+1

TP = MP − 1 ,

SNF (TP) = diag (g, 1, . . . , 1, 0, . . . , 0)

(7.22)

where g = gcd(n, n1, . . . , ns) and we have s − 1 vanishing entries. With this we compute

  Zn−1

L0P = Tor

TPZn−1

(7.23)

When ns 6= 0, we instead find L0P = 0.
17Here we regard all sheets having trivial monodromy to be in the same "orbit" for uniformity of presentation.

Example: P0 puncture. Let us consider the example of P0 puncture, which has s =
1, p1 = 1, q1 = n. There is a Zn monodromy around the P0 puncture. That is, all the n
sheets are cyclically permuted amongst themselves. We label the sheets by weights wi of the
n-dimensional fundamental representation such that these are permuted as wi → wi+1 with
n + 1 ≡ 1. We have the roots αa = wa − wa+1 where a = 1, . . . , n − 1. With respect to this
labelling the monodromy action on sheets leads to the following action on the roots

αa → αa+1 ∀ 1 ≤ a ≤ n − 2 ,

7.6 Trapped Defect Group from Type IIB on CY3
As we discussed earlier, for a puncture P of IHS type we have an alternate geometric method
for computing the trapped part of the defect group LTP based on the associated isolated
hypersurface singularity XP. The 4d N = 2 SCFT TP associated to an untwisted A-type IHS
puncture P is an AD theory of type A, with the following isolated hypersurface realization:

AD[An, Ak] :

1 + xn+1
x2

2 + x2

3 + xk+1

4 = 0 .

The results in [17,30,55] show that for any k, n these have a trivial defect group

= 0 .

having b = N − 1 and arbitrary k, one

8 Untwisted D

In this section, we describe our proposal for computing the defect groups associated to un-
twisted punctures for 6d D-type (2, 0) theories. The key information that we use about these
punctures is discussed in subsection 8.1. We not only consider conformal punctures of IHS
type, but also numerous other classes of conformal and non-conformal punctures.

In subsection 8.2, we make our proposal. For each puncture, we assign a 4d N = 2 gener-
alized quiver gauge theory involving both perturbative and strongly coupled matter sectors,
and propose that the defect groups associated to the generalized quiver gauge theory capture
the defect groups of the associated punctures.

In subsection 8.2.1, we expand on our motivation for making the proposal discussed in
subsection 8.2. We describe a large class of punctures P for which the 4d N = 2 theories TP0P
coincide with the proposed generalized quivers. A subclass of this class of punctures, whose
associated generalized quivers involve only perturbative matter content, can be realized in
terms of Hanany-Witten brane setups in IIA involving O4 planes.

Before using the proposal of subsection 8.2 to compute defect groups associated to un-
twisted D-type punctures, one needs to understand some properties of the strongly coupled
matter sectors appearing in the generalized quivers associated to these punctures. These
properties are derived in subsection 8.3, and subsequently used in subsection8.4 to derive the
defect groups associated to untwisted D-type punctures. Unlike untwisted A-type punctures,
we find that untwisted D-type punctures can carry trapped 1-form symmetries.

Non-trivial checks of this proposal are provided using the IIB ALE fibrations in subsection
8.5. In subsection 8.6.1, we use the IHS realization to compute the trapped defect groups of
IHS punctures, and find a perfect match with the trapped defect groups computed using our
proposal. The 4d N = 2 theories constructed by the IHS include the well-studied (A,D) type
Argyres-Douglas theories, which are known to have non-trivial 1-form symmetry in general. In
subsection 8.6.2, we study other IHS that construct trinion theories involving three untwisted

76

D-type punctures. In all such cases, we find that the defect group of the trinion theory as
computed using IHS maps the defect group as computed using our proposal.

8.1 Punctures
Now we consider punctures for 6d Dn N = (2, 0) theory. These are described in terms of a
Hitchin field in vector representation of Dn.

The i-th block of the Hitchin field takes the form

Bi = 1
t1+ri

Ai + ···

(8.1)

Again we order the blocks such that ri ≥ ri+1 and let s be biggest value of i for which ri > 0.
For each i ≤ s, we write

where 1 ≤ qi ≤ 2n and gcd(pi, qi) = 1.

Let us again define

ri = pi
qi

ni := 2n − iX

j=1

(8.2)

(8.3)

qj

We impose extra conditions on the punctures that can be described in terms of ni as follows.
If ni is even (including n0 := 2n) and qi+1 is odd, then we require

qi+2 = qi+1

(8.4)

This in particular ensures that ni−1 and ni+1 are even if ni is odd. Furthermore, we require
that ns is even. If s is odd then ns ≥ 2, and if s is even then ns ≥ 0.

Similar to the untwisted A-type punctures, an untwisted D-type puncture is conformal
only if ri = rj for all i, j ∈ {1, 2,··· , s}. Out of these, the IHS punctures discussed in [81,88]
are those for which ns = 0, 2.

The conformal untwisted-DN punctures P b

of IHS type have b = 2N − 2 or b = N. The
associated to b = 2N − 2 are the AD[A, D] theories. Again, there is a prediction
, which we discuss

theories TP b
from the hyper-surface realization for the defect group of the theories TP b
in section 8.6.

theory lying in the class Db
4d N = 2 theory T∗
so(2m − 2). The puncture P is characterized by

(G) of 4d N = 2 SCFTs. This theory can be recognized as the
P associated to an untwisted puncture P of 6d N = (2, 0) theory of type

s = 2,

q1 = q2 = m − 2,

(8.22)
For even m, it can also be recognized as a Lagrangian 4d N = 2 theory carrying usp(m − 2)
gauge algebra and m full hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation. On the other
hand, for odd m, there is no such Lagrangian description available. This is the case that arises
as matter SCFT in the generalized quivers discussed above.

p1 = p2 = 1

In order to determine the defect group associated to the generalized quivers discussed
above, we need to determine the defect group of C(2m + 1), and additionally also determine
the flavor center charges of the genuine local operators in the C(2m + 1) SCFT. For this
purpose, we utilize another Class S construction of C(2m + 1) discussed in [62] (where this
model was called R2,2m−1) that uses only regular punctures. This involves the compactification
of 6d N = (2, 0) theory of type su(2m − 1) on a sphere with three regular punctures. One
of the punctures is maximal regular (whose associated partition is [12m−1]). The other two
punctures are of the same type, described by partition [m − 1, m − 1, 1]. Since the Class S
compactification involves only regular punctures, the defect group of lines of C(2m + 1) must
be trivial [31]. Thus there is no contribution to defect group from a node of the form (8.11)
in the generalized quivers discussed above.

80

The manifest flavor symmetry (visible from the regular punctures) is only

fman = su(2m − 1) ⊕ u(2) ⊕ u(2)

(8.23)
with su(2m − 1) subfactor arising from the maximal puncture, and the two u(2) subfactors
arising from the two other punctures. For our purposes, it would be sufficient to keep track
of only the non-abelian part of the manifest flavor symmetry which is

(8.24)
which embeds into so(4m − 2) ⊕ so(4) and then further into so(4m + 2) part of the full flavor
symmetry algebra

man = su(2m − 1) ⊕ so(4) ,
fna

fC(2m+1) = so(4m + 2) ⊕ u(1)

(8.25)
We can easily study representations of local operators under fman or fna
man using the method
of [104]. We find that there exist local operators charged in spinor and cospinor irreps of
so(4), while being uncharged under su(2m− 1). This implies that the theory C(2m + 1) must
contain a local operator charged in spinor irrep S of so(4m + 2).

This local operator is charged under

SC ⊕ CS

(8.26)
representation of so(2p) ⊕ so(4m + 2 − 2p) subalgebra of so(4m + 2). Thus, in the generalized
quivers discussed above, we can replace a sub-quiver of the form

81

8.3.2 The D(m) SCFT
The theory D(m) is a 4d N = 2 SCFT which is better known as the D2m−4
theory lying in the class Db
the 4d N = 2 theory T∗
so(2m − 2). The puncture P is characterized by

(cid:17)
SO(2m− 2)/Z2
(G/Zi) of 4d N = 2 SCFTs. This theory can be recognized as
P associated to a twisted puncture P of 6d N = (2, 0) theory of type

(cid:16)

p

s = 2,

q1 = q2 = m − 2,

p1 = p2 = 1 ,

(8.31)

where the data characterized twisted punctures of D type is discussed in section 9.1. For even
m, it can also be recognized as a Lagrangian 4d N = 2 theory carrying so(m) gauge algebra
and m− 2 hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation. On the other hand, for odd m,
there is no such Lagrangian description available. This is the case that arises as matter SCFT
in the generalized quivers discussed above.

In order to determine the defect group associated to the generalized quivers discussed
above, we need to determine the defect group of D(2m + 1), and additionally also determine
the flavor center charges of the genuine local operators in the D(2m + 1) SCFT. For this
purpose, we utilize another construction of the D(2m+1). We propose that D(2m+1) can be
obtained as a circle reduction of the 5d SCFT that admits a relevant deformation to 5d N = 1
gauge theory carrying su(2m) gauge algebra at CS level 0 and 4m − 2 fundamental hypers.
The circle reduction involves a twist by charge conjugation symmetries associated to su(2m)
gauge algebra and su(4m − 2) flavor algebra. Our proposal is an extension of the proposal
made in [107] for the case of m = 2.

Since the 5d theory has no line and surface defects modulo screening, we deduce that
D(2m + 1) has no defect group of lines. Thus there is no contribution to defect group from a
node of the form (8.13) in the generalized quivers discussed above.

To compute the flavor center charges of the genuine local operators in the D(2m + 1)

SCFT, we look at the magnetic quiver of the 5d theory, which is [108]

u(1)

u(2m − 1)

(8.32)
where the balanced nodes and the edges connecting them are shown in blue. The balanced sub-
quiver forms an su(4m− 2) Dynkin diagram corresponding to the su(4m− 2) flavor symmetry
of the 5d theory. Following the proposal of [109], because the circle reduction involves the

u(2)

82

outer automorphism of su(4m − 2), the magnetic quiver for the 4d theory can be obtained by
folding the magnetic quiver of the 5d theory by the action of the outer-automorphism. Thus,
the magnetic quiver for the 4d D(2m + 1) SCFT is

u(1)

(8.33)

Non simply-laced quivers like (8.33) were first introduced in [110], where a prescription for com-
puting their Coulomb branch Hilbert seris was proposed. The Coulomb branch is essentially
obtained from that of the underlying simply-laced quiver (8.32) by restricting to monopole
configurations invariant under the outer-automorphism action (see also [111]). From the quiver
(8.33) we manifestly see the usp(4m−2) flavor symmetry subalgebra of the D(2m+1) theory.
The fact that we have an unbalanced node attached to the (2m−1)th node of the usp(4m−2)
algebra implies that we have a genuine (Higgs branch) local operator in the D(2m + 1) theory
that transforms in the representation Λ2m−1 obtained by antisymmetrizing the (2m − 1)th
power of the fundamental irrep of usp(4m−2). The local operator carries a non-trivial charge
under the Z2 center of the simply connected group U Sp(4m− 2) associated to the flavor alge-
bra usp(4m− 2). This implies that we must have another genuine local operator in the theory
carrying the fundamental irrep F of usp(4m − 2).

This local operator is charged under

F ⊕ F

(8.34)

representation of usp(2p)⊕usp(4m−2−2p) subalgebra of usp(4m−2). Thus, in the generalized
quivers discussed above, we can replace a sub-quiver of the form

be of Type I if exactly one of its neighbors is a C(odd) SCFT. Let µ1 be the number of so

(cid:5). Similarly, let us call an so gauge node to be of Type

II if none of its neighbors is a C(odd) SCFT. Let µ2 be the number of so gauge nodes of Type
II. Let us define ν2 = 1 if ν1 + µ2 > 0 and ν2 = 0 if ν1 = µ2 = 0. Moreover, let µ3 be the
number of nodes carrying D(odd) SCFT. Finally, let us also define µs = ns if s is even, and
µs = ns − 2 if s is odd.

Then we can divide the result into the following cases:
• Consider the case when µ1 + µ3 + µs > 0. Then we have

HTP = Zν1+µ2−ν2
2
ZP = Zν2
2
HP = HTP × ZP

HTP = Zµ2−1
2
ZP = Z4
HP = HTP × ZP

(8.39)

with iP mapping HTP identically to the HTP subfactor of HP.

• Consider the case when µ1 = µ3 = µs = 0 and n = 2m + 1. Then we have

HP. Correspondingly, the map πP maps the Zµ2−2
subfactor of HP to zero in ZP, the
generator of Z4 subfactor of HP to the generator of one of the Z2 subfactors of ZP, and
the final Z2 subfactor of HP identically to the other Z2 subfactor of ZP.

8.5 Spectral Cover Monodromies
The behavior of the Higgs field near the puncture takes the form

vni

where I is the set of 1 ≤ i ≤ s for which ni is even, k is an integer and

F(v, t) = v2n +X
jX

i∈I

Pj :=

pi

i=1

(8.44)

(8.45)

This is similar to the behavior for untwisted A-type punctures, along with an extra constant
term v0t0. If the term 1/tk is not added, then the v-values for two sheets coincide in the vicinity
of the puncture. In such cases, the constant term provides a distance between the two sheets,
allowing us to read the full monodromy. Different values of k lead to distinct monodromies
and which value of k captures the generic monodromy depends on the (extended) Coulomb
branch of the set-up.

Fix a point t0 6= 0 in the vicinity of the puncture. There are only n independent values
of v solving F(v, t0) = 0, as the other n values of v are fixed to be negatives of the former n
values, due to the symmetry v → −v of F(v, t) = 0. We can identify a set of n independent
values of v solving F(v, t0) = 0 as n of the weights ea for 1 ≤ a ≤ n. The other n values of v
solving F(v, t0) = 0 are identified with the weights −ea.

85

As one goes around the puncture t0 → e2πit0, the 2n weights are permuted into each other.

This induces an action on the roots, which can be identified as

αa = ea − ea+1

(8.46)

for 1 ≤ a ≤ n − 1 and

(8.47)
Let the action on the roots associated to a puncture P be denoted by an n × n matrix MP.

(8.50)

where we have moved onto the Coulomb branch to resolve an order two degeneracy with v = 0.
There is a Z2n−2×Z2 monodromy around the P0 puncture. That is, 2n−2 sheets are cyclically
permuted amongst themselves while a pair of sheets are interchanged along the same path.
We pick a set of n pairwise linearly independent sheets and label these by weights ea of the
2n-dimensional vector representation such that these are permuted as

8.6 Trapped Defect Group from Type IIB on CY3
Again, the trapped part of the defect group can be computed from the Type IIB realization
on IHS singularities.

8.6.1 Trapped Parts of IHS Punctures
For a IHS-puncture P, we can compute the trapped defect group using their isolated hyper-
surface singularity XP realization.

The theories of with untwisted D type class S with irregular punctures can be realized
using the following hypersurface singularities: the AD[A, D], which have the hypersurface
realizations in type IIB as

For the hypersurface X7,1(2,n−1,2,l) the result is shown for low values of l, n in table 5.

Below, we match these results with the trapped defect group of the IHS punctures com-
puted using our proposal. An IHS puncture is characterized by two numbers b, k, where the
possible values of b are n, 2n − 2. These values of b correspond respectively to ns = 0, 2.
The number k is any positive integer. Since the IHS punctures are conformal, they have the
property that all pi are equal and all qi are equal. Let r = ri, p = pi, q = qi. Then, we can
write r as

8.6.2 Trinions
Using IHS, we can construct trinion theories of the form discussed in section 6.5.2, where each
puncture Pi is an IHS puncture. Let ki, bi describe the data of these punctures. To compute
the defect group LP1,P2,P3 of the trinion theory, we need to first compute ZPi

• If qi is odd, then µ1 > 0 and ν2 = 0, so we have

where ZG = Z2

This can be matched with the defect group results obtained from the isolated hypersurface
singularities, appearing in Tables 15, 16 and 20 of [29].

9 Twisted D

In this section, we describe our proposal for computing the defect groups associated to twisted
punctures for 6d D-type (2, 0) theories. The analysis will largely be similar to that for un-
twisted D-type punctures, with only minor cosmetic differences. The key information that
we use about these twisted punctures is discussed in subsection 9.1. Again, we not only
consider conformal punctures of IHS type, but also numerous other classes of conformal and
non-conformal punctures.

91

In subsection 9.2, we make our proposal. For each puncture, we assign a 4d N = 2 gener-
alized quiver gauge theory involving both perturbative and strongly coupled matter sectors,
and propose that the defect groups associated to the generalized quiver gauge theory capture
the defect groups of the associated punctures.

In subsection 9.2.1, we expand on our motivation for making the proposal discussed in
P o0P
subsection 9.2. We describe a large class of punctures P for which the 4d N = 2 theories T
coincide with the proposed generalized quivers. A subclass of this class of punctures, whose
associated generalized quivers involve only perturbative matter content, can be realized in
terms of Hanany-Witten brane setups in IIA involving O4 planes.

Using the properties of the strongly coupled matter sectors derived in section 8.3, we derive
in subsection 9.3 the defect groups associated to twisted D-type punctures. Like untwisted
D-type punctures, we find that the twisted D-type punctures can also carry trapped 1-form
symmetries.

Non-trivial checks of this proposal are provided using the IIB ALE fibrations in subsection
9.4. In subsection 9.5, we use the IHS realization to compute the trapped defect groups of
IHS punctures, and find a perfect match with the trapped defect groups computed using our
proposal.

9.1 Punctures
Let us consider twisted punctures for 6d Dn N = (2, 0) theory. These are described in terms
of a Hitchin field in vector representation of Dn. The i-th block of the Hitchin field takes the
form

(9.1)
Again we order the blocks such that ri ≥ ri+1 and let s be biggest value of i for which ri > 0.
For each i ≤ s, we write

Ai + ···

Bi = 1
t1+ri

where 1 ≤ qi ≤ 2n − 2 and gcd(pi, qi) = 1.

Let us again define

ri = pi
qi

ni := 2n − iX

j=1

(9.2)

(9.3)

qj

We impose extra conditions on the punctures that can be described in terms of ni as follows.
If ni is even (including n0 := 2n) and qi+1 is odd, then we require

qi+2 = qi+1

92

(9.4)

This in particular ensures that ni−1 and ni+1 are even if ni is odd. Furthermore, we require
that ns is even. If s is even then ns ≥ 2, and if s is odd then ns ≥ 0.

As for untwisted A and D type punctures, the twisted D type punctures are also conformal
only if ri = rj for all i, j ∈ {1, 2,··· , s}. Out of these, the punctures of type IHS discussed
in [89] are those for which ns = 0, 2.
9.2 Class GQ of Generalized Quivers
Consider a puncture P of the above type. Then we conjecture that P ∈ Fτ where τ is a
generalized quiver that can be constructed using the data of ni as follows. The quiver takes
the form

usp(2n − 2)

N1

N2

The node Ni is either a gauge algebra or a matter SCFT, depending on whether ni is even or
odd respectively. If ni is even, we write

If i is odd, we have

and if i is even, we have

Ni = gi

gi = so(ni)

gi = usp(ni − 2)

The same applies to the flavor algebra gs. If s is odd, we have

and if s is even, we have

gi = so(ns)

gi = usp(ns − 2)

The edges have the same meaning as discussed in section 8.2.

Ni = D(ni)

9.2.1 Class GQ0 and Type IIA Punctures
The Class GQ0 of punctures is given by punctures having pi = 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ s. The Type
IIA punctures form a subclass of GQ0 for which all qi and hence all ni are even. In such a
situation, every node Ni in (5.2) is a gauge algebra, which is so(ni) for i odd and usp(ni − 2)
for i even. The Type IIA brane construction corresponding to a Type IIA puncture P0 is

9.3 1-Form Symmetries
As proposed above, we can compute the defect group associated to a twisted puncture P by
computing the defect group associated to a generalized quiver of the form (9.5). We describe
the result in terms of the quantities µ1, ν1, µ2, µ3 introduced in section 8.4. We also define a
new quantity νs defined as νs := ns if s is odd, and νs := ns − 2 if s is even. Then, we can
divide the result into the following cases:

• Consider the case when µ1 + µ3 + νs > 0. Then we have

2

HTP = Zν1+µ2
ZP = 0
HP = HTP × ZP

(9.14)

with iP mapping HTP identically to the HTP subfactor of HP.

• Consider the case when µ1 = µ3 = νs = 0, and n2i+1 = 4m2i+1 for all integers 0 < i <

s−1
2 . Then we have

with iP mapping HTP identically to the HTP subfactor of HP.

(9.15)

• Consider the case when µ1 = µ3 = νs = 0, and n2i+1 = 4m2i+1 + 2 for at least one

2 . Then we have
HTP = Zµ2−1

ZP = Z2
HP = Zµ2−1

Unlike the above cases, in this case, the short exact sequence

0 → HTP → HP → ZP → 0

does not split. The map iP maps Zµ2−1
sub-
factor of HP, and the Z2 subfactor of HTP to the Z2 subgroup of the Z4 subfactor of HP.
Correspondingly, the map πP maps the Zµ2−1
subfactor of HP to zero in ZP, and the
generator of the Z4 subfactor of HP to the generator of ZP = Z2.

The extra constant term v0t−1 is added to resolve the distances between the sheets, which
allows us to read the full monodromy.

Fix a point t0 6= 0 in the vicinity of the puncture. As discussed earlier, there are only n
independent values of v solving F(v, t0) = 0. We again identify a set of n independent values
of v solving F(v, t0) = 0 as n of the weights ea for 1 ≤ a ≤ n. The other n values of v solving
F(v, t0) = 0 are identified with the weights −ea.

As one goes around the puncture t0 → e2πit0, the 2n weights are permuted into each other.
This induces an action on the roots, which can be identified as in (8.46) and (8.47). Let the
action on the roots associated to a puncture P be denoted by an n × n matrix MP. Then, as
before, we have the identification

9.5 Trapped Defect Group from Type IIB on CY3
For a puncture P of IHS type, we can compute its trapped defect group using an isolated
hypersurface singularity XP providing a check for our above proposal.

There are again two types of IHS that are relevant for twisted D type theories: the first is

X{7,1}(2,l+1,n−1,2) :

1 + xl+1
x2

2 + x2xn−1

3 + x3x2

4 = 0 .

This singularity has associated to it b = 2n − 2 and k = l + 2n − 2. And the second is

X{10,1}(2,2,n−1,l+2) :

1 + x2
x2

2x3 + xn−1

3 x4 + xl+2

4 x2 = 0 .

(9.35)

(9.36)

This singularity has associated to it b = 2n and k = l + n + 1. The defect groups computed
using IHS techniques are presented in tables 6 and 7.

Let us now find the trapped defect group for an IHS puncture according to our proposal
outlined in the above subsections. An IHS puncture is characterized by two numbers b, k,

where the possible values of b are 2n, 2n − 2. These values of b correspond respectively to
ns = 0, 2. The number k is any positive integer. Since the IHS punctures are conformal, they
have the property that all pi are equal and all qi are equal. Let r = ri, p = pi, q = qi. Then,
we can write r as

s = gcd(k, b)
s = gcd(2k + 1, b)

• Assume q is odd. Then µ1 = µ2 = 0, so we find that

LTP = 0

• Assume q is even. Then µ1 = 0 and µ2 =j s+1

This can be verified with the results appearing in tables 6 and 7.

10 Untwisted E

In this section, we derive the full defect groups associated to untwisted IHS punctures of E-
type 6d N = (2, 0) theories. This is achieved by combining the two different string-theoretic
constructions we have been using so far: namely the IHS construction, and the construction

99

as ALE fibration with monodromy. Using the IHS description, we read the trapped defect
group LTP from which we deduce

(10.1)
On the other hand, using the ALE fibration description, we read the genuine part L0P of the
defect group LP. Recall that L0P must admit a decomposition as

HTP =qLTP .

L0P = HTP × WP .

(10.2)

Combining it with the knowledge of HTP from (10.1), we can read the group WP. Thus,
combining the two computations, we can deduce WP and W TP = bHTP. The final data needed

is the surjective map

WP → W TP ,

(10.3)

which is apriori not determined even after combining the above two string-theoretic compu-
tations. However, luckily, for untwisted E-type IHS punctures, we find that WP and W TP are
such that there is a unique surjection (10.3). Moreover, this surjection is such that we can
decompose

WP = bZP × W TP .

(10.4)

(10.5)

In other words, the short exact sequence

0 → bZP → WP → W TP → 0

splits, and hence the trapped and non-trapped parts do not mix with each other.

Note that for E8, we do not need to perform the spectral cover computation because for

any such puncture P, we must have bZP = 0 as ZE8 = 0. This implies that

L0P = LTP ,

(10.6)

which can be determined solely from the IHS computation.

Below, in subsection 10.1, we discuss how the weights and roots are encoded for E6,7
spectral covers. Using this, we perform the computation of L0P in subsection 10.2 for E6,
E7 punctures. The data of LTP, L0P, bZP, WP and W TP is given in tables 8, 9 and 10 for E6
punctures; and in tables 11 and 12 for E7 punctures. The data of LTP is given in table13 for
E8 punctures. The short exact sequence (10.5) is then the trivial split sequence derived using
this data.

The spectral curve has deg FE7 = 56 sheets vi and for any value of the Casimirs the sheets

quadruplets satisfying

(10.16)
and no pair of sheets in the same quadruplet summing to zero. Further there are 28 pairs [i, j]
such that

vi + vj + vk + vl = 0 ,

vi + vj = 0 .

(10.17)
Similarly the weights wi of the representation 56 of E7 group into 630 quadruplets and 28
pairs and permitted labelings of sheets by weights are such that these two structures match.
Such labelings are unique up to Weyl transformations. Further details are discussed in the
appendices of [112].

10.2 Spectral Cover Monodromies
In the spectral cover descriptions punctures are specified by boundary conditions on the
Casimirs. We consider punctures localized at t = 0 and labelled by two integers (b, k) such
that

(10.18)
constitutes the leading order behaviour in the limit t → 0 among the Casimirs ui with all other
Casimirs subleading. We denote these punctures by P(b)
n [k] with n = 6, 7, 8 for E6, E7, E8
respectively.

ub = 1

The monodromy on weights informs the mondromy on simple roots, see section 5.3, and
. From (10.18) it now follows that

we denote the associated monodromy matrix by MP(b)
n [k]
the monodromy matrices of the different punctures are related as

and with this we compute the group of genuine lines to be

the trapped defect group via the boundary topology of the associated Calabi-Yau three-fold

X
trapped contributions in tables 8 -- 13. Note, that the rows of the tables are periodic with
k ∼ k + b.

11 Conclusions and Outlook

The main goal of this work is to study the 1-form symmetry groups and line defect groups of
arbitrary 4d N = 2 Class S theories. This problem was recently tackled extensively for the
case of regular punctures in [31], and it was shown that these groups can be encoded in the
topological properties of 1-cycles on the Riemann surface used for Class S construction.

In the present work, we include irregular punctures into the analysis. Once irregular
punctures are included, one quickly realizes, using alternative descriptions of the 4d theories
as discussed in section 3, that there can be extra contributions to the 1-form symmetry and
line defect groups of the Class S theory that are not accounted by 1-cycles on the Riemann
surface. These additional contributions have to be somehow trapped at the locations of the

irregular punctures. Indeed, as we show in this paper, there is a non-trivial line defect group
associated to irregular punctures that contributes to the line defect group of a Class S theory.
This insight from Class S implies a more general, conceptual point: the existence of relative

defects in relative theories.

It is well-known, and we review in sections 2.1 and 2.2, that a non-trivial defect group
indicates that the theory under study is a relative theory attached to a TQFT in one higher
dimension.
In the same way, as explained in detail in section 2, the fact that a puncture
of a 6d N = (2, 0) theory carries a defect group means that it is a relative codimension-
two defect attached to a topological system in one higher dimension. Since 6d N = (2, 0)
theory is a relative theory, we learn that a general codimension-two defect of a 6d N = (2, 0)
theory is a relative defect inside a relative theory. This has the interesting consequence that
the topological system attached to the relative codimension-two defect is itself a topological
defect of the TQFT attached to the 6d N = (2, 0) theory.

We discuss the general formalism of relative defects in relative theories in section 2. The
results of this paper provide interesting and concrete examples of such relative defects in the
form of codimension-two defects of 6d N = (2, 0) theories.

The full line defect group of a puncture can be divided into trapped and non-trapped
parts. The non-trapped part is related to the surface defect group of the parent 6d N = (2, 0)
theory, while the trapped part is not related to the bulk surface defect group, but arises as a
contribution from the puncture (i.e. codimension two defect). It is important to know how
the trapped and non-trapped parts combine to form the full line defect group associated to a
puncture. The combination is captured by a short exact sequence, which is non-split whenever
the trapped and non-trapped parts combine non-trivially. The details about the structure of
line defect groups of punctures, and its usage in the computation of the line defect group of
an arbitrary Class S theory, are discussed in section 4.

We obtain explicit expressions for the line defect groups of many classes of conformal and
non-conformal untwisted A- and D-types, and twisted D-type punctures. This is done by
proposing that the line defect groups of punctures are the same as line defect groups of a class
of 4d N = 2 generalized quiver gauge theories.

Many of the classes of punctures that we discuss (even the conformal ones) have not
appeared prior in the literature. A sub-class of these new punctures can be constructed using
Hanany-Witten brane setups in Type IIA string theory, and generalizations thereof.

We use two geometric constructions of punctures in Type IIB string theory to test the
proposed defect groups. Using such geometric constructions, we can compute important pieces
of the full defect groups of the punctures, which can then be matched with the proposals.

109

One of these constructions employs the use of isolated hypersurface Calabi-Yau threefold
singularities in IIB, using which we can compute trapped parts of the defect groups associated
to punctures. The other construction involves ALE fibrations over a punctured complex plane.
The monodromies of these ALE fibrations can be used to compute the genuine part of the
defect group associated to the punctures.

Combining these two geometric constructions, we are able to also derive defect groups

associated to a class of well-known conformal untwisted E-type punctures.

Conceptually, we expect the ALE-fibration to contain the same information as the Class S
construction. What we have shown in this paper, is how to geometrically extract the genuine
part of the defect group associated to the punctures. However, as we explained in section 5.3,
we do not understand how to combine this and describe the full defect group of the puncture,
which is locally modelled by the ALE-fibration. It would be very interesting to develop this
line of reasoning further.

In this paper we focused on codimension 2 defects in Class S constructions. Naturally,
this should have extensions to N = 1 versions of Class S theories, and potentially interesting
implications for studies of confinement. More broadly, we expect relative defects in relative
theories to also play a role in other contexts of compactifications from higher-dimensional
relative theories, e.g. 6d to 3d and 2d.

B Spectral Cover Monodromies
Consider a puncture P in a theory of class S with bulk Lie algebra g. Let t be a local coordinate
for a patch of the UV curve centered on the puncture and v a coordinate on the cotangent
fibers projecting to this patch. The differential is λ = vdt/t and the spectral curve is locally
a polynomial

F(v, t) = 0 .

(B.1)

For further details on the set-up see the discussion in section 5.3. The curves for untwisted
Lie algebras g = An, Dn, E6 were discussed in sections 7.5, 8.5, 10 respectively.

The vanishing locus of the discriminant of F with respect to v determines the t coordinate

of the branch points, these solve

(B.2)
The monodromy action on the sheets vi of the spectral curve F associated to the puncture
P follows from considering a small loop linking P which does not enclose any of the branch
points solving (B.2).

∆(F, v)(t) = 0 .

We present a convenient numerical method for determining the monodromy action on
sheets. This method employs Mathematica and is independent of the bulk Lie algebra g
which determines the map from this monodromy action to the monodromy on roots after
choosing a labelling of sheets by weights. As an example let us consider the curve

F(v, t) = Pn1(v)t2 + Pn2(v)t + Pn3(v) = 0

(B.3)

with n2 − n3 > n1 − n2 > 0. Here Pni
are polynomials of degree ni. We set all physical
constants to one as we are solely interested in ramification structure of the cover at t = 0.
The leading order terms of the curve in the limit t → 0 are

F0(v, t) = vn1t2 + vn2t + vn3 = 0 .

(B.4)

114

Figure 26: Example of the Mathematica out-put for (n1, n2, n3) = (20, 17, 5) and (c1, c2, c3) =
(1, 1, 0) and k = 2. The t-plane and v-plane are plotted in the same plane. The black dot sets
the value of t and can be dragged. The green dot marks t = 0 while the purple dots mark a
fixed reference frame in the t-plane. The roots vi(t) are displayed by red dots. Drag the black
dot around the green dot to watch them permute. We clearly see three monodromy orbits of
cardinality 3, 12, 5 permuted cyclically.

The roots of this equation are n3-fold degenerate for v = 0 and all t. This degeneracy needs
to be lifted to study the monodromy at generic points of the extended Coulomb branch. We
therefore tune to a more generic part of the extended Coulomb branch by turning on the
constants ci as

P0(v, t) = (vn1 + c1)t2 + (vn2 + c2)t + vn3 + c3 = 0 .

(B.5)
The physics of the set-up constrains which constants ci are permitted to be non-vanishing.
The constant ci with the smallest index then determines the generic monodromy behaviour of
the previously degenerate roots.

The roots of P0 organize into three monodromy orbits of order n1 − n2, n2 − n3, n3. The
orbits group roots by their scaling behavior in the limit t → 0. Roots of the first two orbits
diverge upon approaching the puncture. Encircling the puncture counter-clockwise the orbits
with n1 − n2 and n2 − n3 roots experience a cyclic permutation clockwise. The orbit with n3
roots is permuted 3 − k times counter-clockwise where k is the largest index for which ci 6= 0.

115

An explicit example can be viewed using the Mathematica code:

Manipulate[n=20;index=Table[i,{i,n}];
Poly=v^5+(v^(17)+1)(t[[1]]+I t[[2]])+(v^(20)+1)(t[[1]]+I t[[2]])^2;
scale=0.5;roots=NSolve[Poly==0,v];rts=v/.roots[[index]];
Graphics[{Green,Disk[{0, 0},.03], Black,Disk[t,.03],Red,Table[Disk[{Re[rts[[i]]],
Im[rts[[i]]]},.04],{i,n}],Purple,{Disk[{1,0},.03],Disk[{-1,0},.03],Disk[{0,1},.03],
Disk[{0,-1},.03]}},PlotRange->5, ImageSize->1000],
{{t,{1/20,0}}, {-5,-5},{5,5},Locator,Appearance->None},TrackedSymbols->True]

which produces the out-put shown in figure 26. More general polynomials F(v, t) of arbitrary
order in t are analyzed similarly. Once the monodromy on sheets is known, a labelling of
sheets by weights is picked and from it the monodromy action on roots is inferred.

As a final example we include the Mathematica code used in the analysis of the E6 example

of section 10.2.

Manipulate[n = 27; index = Table[i, {i, n}];
Poly = 1/27 - (53 v^9)/3 + 28 v^18 + v^27 - v^3/( 108 (t[[1]] + I t[[2]])^2) +
(2 v^6)/(3 (t[[1]] + I t[[2]])) + ( 5 v^15)/(t[[1]] + I t[[2]]);
scale = 0.5; roots = NSolve[Poly == 0, v]; rts = v /.
