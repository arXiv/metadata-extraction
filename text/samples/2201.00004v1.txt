This paper proposes an algorithm to find robust reliability-
based topology optimized designs under a random-field ma-
terial model. The initial design domain is made of linear
elastic material whose property, i.e., Young's modulus, is
modeled by a random field. To facilitate computation, the
Karhunen− -- Lo`eve expansion discretizes the modeling ran-
dom field into a small number of random variables. Robust-
ness is achieved by optimizing a weighted sum of mean and
standard deviation of a quantity of interest, while reliability
is employed through a probabilistic constraint. The Smolyak-
type sparse grid and the stochastic response surface method
are applied to reduce computational cost. Furthermore, an
efficient inverse-reliability algorithm is utilized to decouple
the double-loop structure of reliability analysis. The pro-
posed algorithm is tested on two common benchmark prob-
lems in literature. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation is used to
validate the claimed robustness and reliability of optimized
designs.

Introduction
A mechanical structure is characterized by its boundary
and loading conditions, its material properties, and its topol-
ogy. Finding an appropriate topology is often a major task
in structural design, which has fueled the rise of topology
optimization (TO) in the last two decades. Without consid-
ering a designer's experience, TO is a mathematical tool to
identify the optimal size, shape, and connectivity of a de-
sign [1], resulting in improved performance while using the
least amount of material. However, research in TO often
only concerns with deterministic inputs, while uncertainty
is inherent in nature, which manifests itself in the stochastic-
ity of random parameters of engineered systems. The anal-

ysis and design of engineered systems are affected heavily
by uncertainty; for example, modern design codes, such as
ACI 318 [2] and AISC 360 [3], have comprehensive recom-
mendations of safety factors for loading, material property,
construction conditions, etc., which obviously are intended
to take into account uncertainty. Among different sources
of uncertainty, material property is intrinsically random in
space, which has been modeled by random field in the de-
sign of composite structures [4, 5, 6]. Such a modeling tech-
nique has been especially popular in the vast literature of the
Stochastic Finite Element Method [7, 8, 9], which certainly
proves its validity and the need to be considered in TO. So
far, uncertainty in TO has been treated separately by robust
optimization or reliability-based optimization, while both ro-
bustness and reliability are desired properties of design under
uncertainty. Therefore, this paper presents an algorithm to
find robust reliability-based topology optimized design un-
der a random-field material model.

There are a number of steps in our proposed algo-
rithm, which are addressed in depth in the subsequent
sections. Here we provide a brief overview of them.
First, from a known covariance function, the modeling ran-
dom field is estimated by a random polynomial using the
Karhunen− -- Lo`eve expansion. To make the design robust,
a weighted sum of mean and standard deviation of a quantity
of interest, which are computed by a Smolyak-type sparse
grid, is considered as the objective function. Reliability of
the design is reflected in the probabilistic constraint, which
is handled by the Sequential Optimization and Reliability
Assessment (SORA) method [10]−a single-loop inverse-
reliability algorithm−coupled with the performance measure
approach [11] to reduce the computational cost of reliability
analysis. The stochastic response surface method approxi-
mates the random output, which is required to solve the in-

verse reliability analysis problem.

The layout of this paper is as follows. Section 2 is
a literature review of uncertainty propagation, robust and
reliability-based optimization, and reliability analysis, with
focus on TO under uncertainty. Section 3 derives the math-
ematical formulation of the deterministic TO problem and
the robust reliability-based topology optimization (RRBTO)
problem. This section also exposes the details of our pro-
posed solution for the RRBTO problem. Two numerical ex-
amples show how our proposed algorithm works, and are
verified by Monte Carlo simulation in section 4 followed by
discussions of the results. Finally, the paper is summarized
with major findings, and then suggests future work.

2 Background

The earliest idea of topology optimization (TO) can be
traced back to Michell's paper [12] in 1904. Since then TO
has been mature enough to have its own treatise [1]. As a
mathematical optimization problem, TO requires specifica-
tion of objective function(s) and constraint(s), which do not
involve any probabilistic quantities when using deterministic
inputs. Thus, changes are needed to deal with uncertainty
in the forms of robust optimization (RO) and reliability-
based optimization (RBO). A number of papers, which are
reviewed below, have tried to integrate uncertainty into a TO
problem using RO and RBO separately.

RO primarily aims to minimize the variability of an
output of interest [13], due to uncertainty, around its mean
value. Therefore, this goal can be formulated by minimizing
a weighted sum of mean and standard deviation of the output
of interest. This approach was chosen in several papers cov-
ering various sources of uncertainty and solution methods:
spatial variation of manufacturing error with Monte Carlo
simulations [14]; random-field truss material with a multi-
objective approach [15]; random loading field and random
material field with the level set method [16]; material and
geometric uncertainties with stochastic collocation methods
and perturbation techniques [17, 18]; misplacement of ma-
terial and imperfect geometry [19, 20]; Young's modulus of
truss members with a perturbation method [21]; random-field
material properties with a polynomial chaos expansion [22];
geometric and material property uncertainties with a stochas-
tic perturbation method for frame structures [23]; material
uncertainty with known second-order statistics [24]; random
spatial distribution of Young's modulus and loading uncer-
tainty in a stress-based problem [25,26]; and random loading
field with stochastic collocation methods [27]. The robust
topology optimization (RTO) problem is solved by a unified
framework based on polynomial chaos expansion in [28],
while [29] tackled the problem exploiting the linear elas-
ticity of structure. The seemingly arbitrary factors in the
weighted sum are often cited as one major weakness of this
RO methodology [30, 15]; however, they are well-defined in
decision-based design reflecting risk-taking attitude of de-
signers [31, 32, 33].
Instead of modifying the objective function, RBO makes
some of the constraints probabilistic−probability of failure

event is used in place of the event itself. This change requires
specialized methods to handle, because the probabilistic con-
straints are expressed by multiple integrals of the joint prob-
ability density function (PDF) of random variables, both of
which are either practically impossible to obtain or very dif-
ficult to evaluate [34]. Many methods have been devised to
overcome such difficulties, which were surveyed thoroughly
in [35]. Within the scope of this paper, we only briefly review
the first-order reliability methods (FORM), the second-order
reliability methods (SORM), and the Sequential Optimiza-
tion and Reliability Assessment (SORA) method. FORM
appeared early [36] together with the concept of reliability
index [37] to solve RBO problems. SORM [38] followed
to improve accuracy of the FORM in case of highly nonlin-
ear limit state functions and/or slow decay of the joint PDF.
The main idea of FORM and SORM is to approximate the
limit state functions using first-order and second-order Tay-
lor series, respectively, at appropriate values (i.e., means) of
random variables. This results in a double-loop optimiza-
tion problem to find the most probable point (MPP). In the
context of reliability-based topology optimization (RBTO),
directly solving the double-loop optimization problem has
been shown in [39] for MEMS mechanisms with stochastic
loading, boundary conditions as well as material properties;
in [40] for shape uncertainty; in [41] for geometric imperfec-
tions; in [42] for frame structures using system reliability un-
der random-variable inputs; in [43] for electromagnetic sys-
tems; in [44] for geometrically nonlinear structures; in [45]
for local failure constraints; and in [46] for continuum struc-
tures subject to local stress constraints. In [47], FORM was
replaced by a mean-value, second-order saddlepoint approx-
imation method, which was asserted to be more accurate.
The double-loop approach is prohibitively expensive and
lacks robustness when a large number of random variables
presents [48]. For this reason, single-loop approaches have
been developed, in which, i.e., the Karush−Kuhn−Tucker
(KKT) optimality conditions are utilized to avoid the inner
loop. Both [49] and [50] used variants of the single-loop
method in [51] for component and system reliability-based
TO. In [52], it is somewhat unique when the authors used
their own single-loop method [53]. Kogiso et al. [54] applied
the single-loop-single-vector method [55] for frame struc-
tures under random-variable loads and nonstructural mass.
Another way to bypass the double-loop problem is the de-
coupling approaches [35], in which reliability analysis re-
sults are used to facilitate the optimization loops. Among
them, the SORA method is known for its simple implemen-
tation compared to the above single-loop methods, and its ef-
ficiency with FORM [10,56]. This method was employed for
RBTO under random-variable inputs in [57] and [58]. Meta
modeling or surrogate modeling used together with simula-
tion techniques to solve RBO problems has received consid-
erable attention [59], but still remained relatively unexplored
in TO literature.
In [60], reliability was assessed using a
probabilistic neural network classifier for truss structures un-
der random Young's modulus.

Both robustness and reliability are desired properties of
design under uncertainty; however, to the best of our knowl-

edge, this paper is the first one considering both criteria in
TO. Therefore, a literature review of robust reliability-based
optimization (RRBO) has to be drawn from other fields. The
RRBO problem was investigated in [61] using an inverse re-
liability strategy; in [62] using a performance moment inte-
gration method to estimate the product quality loss; in [63]
using a preference aggregation method to produce a single-
objective RBO problem; and in [64] under epistemic un-
certainty. Both [65] and [66] used a genetic algorithm to
solve the problem. The dimension reduction method and its
derivatives were introduced in [67, 68, 69] as an alternative
approach to the RRBO problem.

With respect to RBTO, the approaches in [57], [30],
and [70] are closest to ours. Still, random-field modeling was
not used for material property in [57] and [70]. Furthermore,
several concerns can be identified from [70]. One of the most
important stages in their method is the approximation of both
failure probability and its sensitivity, which were calculated
by Monte Carlo sampling. Direct Monte Carlo sampling is
well-known to have variability [71], meaning two indepen-
dent runs are very likely to get different values of failure
probability and its sensitivity which would obviously affect
the optimization results. Another concern is that the value
of the parameter ε needed to replace the Heaviside func-
tion with a smooth approximation [72] and was chosen by a
"recommendation" backed by observation only. In [30], the
modeling random field was assumed with a known marginal
distribution, and in order to apply a perturbation technique,
random variability of Young's modulus had to be small. Both
of these assumptions clearly restrict the general applicability
of their method. Lastly, robustness against uncertainty was
not studied in the three papers. As described in the following
sections, our proposed method considers random field un-
certainty with the Karhunen− -- Lo`eve (KL) expansion used
to reduce the dimension of the random field. The KL ex-
pansion covers a large class of random field without any re-
strictions on random variability. In this way, we are able to
use the FORM-based inverse reliability method within the
SORA framework coupled with the stochastic response sur-
face method to avoid the aforementioned weaknesses of di-
rect Monte Carlo sampling.

where ρρρ is the vector of design variables of the TO prob-

finite-element mesh, respectively; γ is the predetermined vol-
ume fraction; K(ρρρ), u(ρρρ), and f are the stiffness matrix, the
displacement vector, and the external load vector, respec-
tively; and C(ρρρ) is the structural compliance.
In the opti-
mization problem (1), there are three constraints: the first ex-
presses the equilibrium of the structure; the second requires
the optimized design to have a prescribed volume; and the
third is a component-wise inequality, in which each density
(design variable) must be between 1 and a lower limit (i.e.,
ρmin = 0.001).

i

To ensure manufacturability, the optimized design must
have a well-defined boundary, which is not guaranteed if
solving (1) directly because there is nothing to prevent
intermediate values of densities from dominating the de-
sign. Hence, the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization
(SIMP) method [1] is used to make intermediate densities
unfavorable compared to ρmin or 1. According to SIMP,
each finite element has a Young's modulus Ei specified by
Ei = ρp
is the
initial value of the Young's modulus corresponding to unit
density. The interpretation and possible values of p were
elaborated in [73]. Any established gradient-based algo-
rithms can solve the problem (1) after it is converted into
a nonlinear optimization problem using the SIMP method.
This paper follows common practice in the literature, select-
ing the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) [74, 75] as
the optimizer of the DTO problem. The MMA has proved its
reliability and competitive performance in various settings
of TO. However, SIMP alone is plagued with checkerboard-
ing, mesh dependence, and local minima [76]. Many mesh-
independent filtering methods [77] have been designed to
preclude checkerboarding and mesh dependence, while lo-
cal minima remain an open question. This paper uses the
density filtering [78, 79] as implemented in [80]. The next
sections describe how uncertainty shapes our problem for-
mulation and the solution algorithm.

3.2 Robust Reliability-based Topology Optimization
3.2.1 Problem Formulation

Considering input uncertainty modeled by a random
field y(ω,x), a robust reliability-based topology optimization
(RRBTO) problem is formulated as follows:

κ1µ [C(ρρρ,y)] + κ2σ [C(ρρρ,y)]

min
ρρρ
s.t. K(ρρρ,y)u(ρρρ,y) = f,

= γ,

0 < ρmin ≤ ρρρ ≤ 1,

i , i = 1,2 . . . ,m,

(2)

where x ∈ D ⊂ Rd is coordinates of a point
in a d-
dimensional physical domain D; ω ∈ Ω is an element of the

3

sample space Ω; µ [C(ρρρ,y)] and σ [C(ρρρ,y)] are the mean and
standard deviation of the compliance C(ρρρ,y), respectively;
κ1 and κ2 are the real non-negative weighting factors. The
limit state function gi(ρρρ,y) is defined so that gi(ρρρ,y) < 0
means failure of the design, and Pi[gi(ρρρ,y) < 0] shows the
probability of the ith failure event. The target probability P0
i
is the upper bound of the failure probability Pi and often de-
i = Φ(−βi), where βi is the reliability index and
fined as P0
Φ(·) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.
In this paper the random field y(ω,x) is taken to be the mate-
rial Young's modulus, which must be physically meaningful
(i.e., taking only positive values) and is modeled as in [17]:

E(x) = F−1 ◦ Φ [y(ω,x)] ,

(3)

where Φ[·] is the standard normal cumulative distribution
function (CDF), and F−1 is the inverse of a prescribed CDF.
The uniform distribution is chosen for the two numerical ex-
amples resulting in

E(x) = a + (b− a)Φ [y(ω,x)] ,

(4)

where a and b are the two bounds of the distribution. The
log-normal and the beta distribution are also capable of mod-
eling non-negative, bounded physical quantities, which can
supersede the uniform distribution in (3) with minimal effort.
A number of challenges need to be cleared before we
are able to solve (2). The modeling random field, which tries
to capture spatial variability of material property, needs to
be cast into an explicit, computable form because a defined
value of material property is required to perform finite el-
ement analysis. The Karhunen− -- Lo`eve (KL) expansion in
Section 3.2.3 is able to turn a random field into a series of
random variables. The mean and standard deviation of the
compliance, and the probabilistic constraints are often very
hard or expensive to evaluate because of complex geome-
try of their domains. A Smolyak-type sparse grid in Sec-
tion 3.2.2 is an efficient method to calculate the mean and
standard deviation, while Inverse Reliability Analysis (IRA)
and SORA in Section 3.2.4, coupled with the Stochastic Re-
sponse Surface Method (SRSM) in Section 3.2.5, handle the
probabilistic constraints effectively by avoiding the demand-
ing double-loop problem. Combining the above methods, a
detailed description of our proposed algorithm is laid out in
Section 3.2.6.

3.2.2 Smolyak-type Sparse Grid

In practice, it is very difficult or even impossible to
calculate the mean and standard deviation of the compli-
ance in (2) analytically through multidimensional integrals.
Such difficulties have motivated the development of various
numerical methods such as simulation-based methods (i.e.,
Monte Carlo (MC), important sampling, adaptive sampling,
etc.), and the stochastic collocation methods (SCM) [81].
Simulation-based methods are usually more straightforward
to implement and embarrassingly parallel, and their cost does

not depend on the number of dimensions; however, even
with better sampling techniques, they still require a lot more
sampling points than the SCM. Depending on the smooth-
ness of the target function, the convergence rate of the SCM
can be orders of magnitude faster than MC-based methods
[82, 83]. The SCM approximates the quantity of interest by
a weighted sum, whose weighing factors and terms are com-
puted at specific collocation points. Locating such points is
one of the central topics in SCM. The popular approach is
to pick a known one-dimensional quadrature rule and then
build up the multidimensional grid from the one-dimension
rule.
Interested readers can find in [84] a list of popular
quadrature rules. The Gauss-Hermite quadrature, which is
particularly suitable for approximating the mean of a normal
distribution, is selected in this paper. The multidimensional
grid can be constructed using a tensor product; nevertheless,
due to the well-known curse of dimensionality, the cost of
SCM on a full tensor-product grid is still excessively high
for a large number of dimensions. The Smolyak-type sparse
grid (SSG), which may be traced back to the Smolyak algo-
rithm [85], can significantly reduce the cost by using only a
subset of the full tensor grid. In [86] numerical experiments
with random input, whose dimension was up to 50, showed
that the SCM on sparse grids was more efficient than MC.

For the sake of completeness the SSG is reviewed here.
The construction presented below follows [87]. Consider a
d-dimensional function f (x), the difference ∆(1)

ture rule, which is a natural choice for the class of integrals
involving an exponential function over an infinite interval
such as mean and standard deviation [88]. The sparse in-

3.2.3 Karhunen− -- Lo`eve Expansion

In a physical system, the quantity of interest can be mea-
sured at spatial points over the system domain. If a random

field is considered an appropriate model for such a quan-
tity, it is then required to construct the random field from
measurements. Several methods, including the Expansion
Optimal Linear Estimator [89] and polynomial chaos expan-
sion [82, 8], have been adopted. Compared to others, the
Karhunen− -- Lo`eve (KL) expansion [90] is "the most effi-
cient in terms of the number of random variables required
for a given accuracy" [7]. The KL expansion of a random
field y(ω,x) is given as

(cid:112)λiξi(ω)ei(x)

(8)

y(ω,x) = E[x] +

∞
∑

i=1

where E[x] is the mean of the random field. The orthogo-
nal eigenfunctions ei(x) and the corresponding eigenvalues
λi are solutions of the following eigenvalue problem:

K(x1,x2)ei(x)dx = λiei(x) x,x1,x2 ∈ D

(9)

(cid:90)

D

where K(x1,x2) is the covariance function of the random
field

K(x1,x2) = E [y(x1)y(x2)]

x1,x2 ∈ D

(10)

The random variables ξi(ω) are uncorrelated and satisfy:

E[ξi] = 0,E[ξiξ j] = δi j,

ξi(ω) =

1√
λi

(cid:90)

D

(y(ω,x)− E[x])ei(x)dx,

(11)

where δi j is the Kronecker delta. The infinite series in (8) has
to be truncated to use in practice. Because the influence of
higher order terms decays rapidly, satisfactory precision can
be achieved using only the first few terms of the expansion.
The KL expansion requires the solution of the eigen-
value problem (9), which is pretty straightforward in the case
of a random process (1-dimensional random field) [91]. For
the purpose of demonstration and without loss of generality,
this paper in Section 4 assumes the separability of the covari-
ance function of a 2-dimensional random field:

Inverse Reliability Analysis and SORA

The probabilistic constraints formulated as in (2) are
called the reliability index approach (RIA); however, as [11]
reported, the performance measure approach (PMA) pro-
vides better numerical stability and higher rate of conver-
gence. Using the PMA, (2) is transformed as follows:

κ1µ [C(ρρρ,y)] + κ2σ [C(ρρρ,y)]

min
ρρρ
s.t. K(ρρρ,y)u(ρρρ,y) = f,

= γ,

V (ρρρ)
V0
gi(ρρρ,y) ≥ 0, i = 1,2 . . . ,m,
0 < ρmin ≤ ρρρ ≤ 1.

(13)

The most notable change is that the probabilistic constraints
are replaced by inequalities of the limit state functions. Solv-
ing the new problem requires a truncated KL expansion
y(ω,x) ≈ y(ξξξ(ω),x), FORM, and inverse reliability analysis
(IRA). In order to apply FORM, the random vector ΞΞΞ = {ξi}
is first transformed into a vector of standard normal random
variables ΨΨΨ = {ψi} using the Rosenblatt or the Nataf trans-
formation ΨΨΨ = T (ΞΞΞ) or ΞΞΞ = T−1(ΨΨΨ). Then, the most prob-
able point (MPP) ξξξ∗
i in transformed
space is obtained by solving the following IRA problem:

gi(ψψψ)

(14)

where gi(ψψψ) is the ith limit state function in transformed
space.
In this paper, the Matlab CODES toolbox [93] is
chosen to solve (14). Furthermore, the SORA framework
is adopted to decouple the double-loop structure of (13).
In SORA, instead of nesting the optimization problem (14)
within (13), it serializes (13) into a chain of loops of DTO
and IRA (Fig. 1). Each kth loop starts with DTO followed by
IRA:

3.2.5 Stochastic Response Surface Method

As uncertainty is propagated from random input to out-
put through complex computations such as finite element
analysis, it is almost unlikely to derive the output directly
as an explicit expression of input. However, such an expres-
sion is needed to run the gradient-based algorithm in IRA.
The SRSM deals with this difficulty by approximating the
output by a polynomial chaos expansion [82]. The below
formulations follows [95]. The multidimensional Hermite
polynomials of degree p are used in the SRSM and defined
as:

Hp(αi1,αi2, . . . ,αip)
= (−1)pe 1

2 αααT ααα

∂p

∂αi1,∂αi2, . . . ,∂αip

where ααα = {αik}p

sion (18) will become:

system of linear equations using at least ten different realiza-

simpler heuristic rule in [96], which is selected in this paper.
For the approximation in (19) the rule generates 17 colloca-

very close to the target output [95].

3.2.6 Solution Algorithm

The optimization algorithm (Fig. 1) to solve the RRBTO

problem (2) is expounded below:
1. Initialize the problem: size of the finite element mesh;
initial values of design variables, SIMP and optimization
parameters; KL expansion of random field; collocation
points and weights for the SSG, and the SRSM; etc.

The SORA framework coupled with the PMA can save
computational cost significantly by reducing the number of
reliability analyses performed to reach convergence of both
DTO and IRA. However, as a heuristic method, the optimiza-
tion solution ρρρ∗ acquired by SORA may not be the one found
in the double-loop problem, which is corrected in each loop
by shifting the random design variables using information
from the previous loop [94]. Such modification is not neces-
sary in this paper because there are only deterministic design
variables (only the material property is random).

• Deterministic topology optimization (DTO): the most
probable point (MPP) ξξξ∗(k−1)
found in the previous loop
(or some initial values for the first loop) is used in place
of random parameters ξξξ(ω), making (15) a regular TO
problem. The SIMP and the MMA method are em-
ployed to solve it.
• Inverse reliability analysis (IRA): the optimum values
of design variables from the DTO step and the colloca-
tion points given in Section 3.2.5 are used to construct
stochastic response surfaces, which in turn are utilized
in (16) to find the next MPP. Based on convergence con-
ditions, the algorithm may stop, or a new loop is re-
quested with updated Young's modulus using the new
MPP.

4 Results

In this section our proposed algorithm is run on two
common benchmark problems (the cantilever and the L-
shaped beam) with three target reliability levels, six weight-
ing factors, and one parameter tuple of the uniform distribu-
tion in (4). The correctness and accuracy of our algorithm
is then verified on the optimization results by Monte Carlo
simulations. All quantities given below are dimensionless
for simplicity.

To ensure the generality of our approach, we intention-
ally do not specify the limit state functions gi(ρρρ,y) in the
previous sections, which is essential for the two numerical

where u(ρρρ,y) and u0 are the actual displacement and the
minimum allowable displacement at a selected point, respec-
tively. The above formulation is inspired by design of com-
pliant mechanisms [97], in which both flexibility and stiff-
ness are required. Flexibility allows the mechanisms to reach
designed deformation, implied by the limit state function
g(ρρρ,y) = u(ρρρ,y) − u0, while maximizing stiffness, or min-
imizing compliance, helps them withstand loads. Further-
more, the weighting factors κ1 and κ2 need substantial at-
tention. Our preliminary numerical results showed that the
mean and standard deviation of the compliance are differ-
ent by about two orders of magnitude, which may have crit-
ical impact on the solution. This was examined carefully
in [98] and normalization transforming them into the same
scale has been recommended. κ1 and κ2 are identified ac-
cording to [21]:

κ1 =

(23)

where ε ∈ [0,1], µ∗ is the mean of the compliance when
(ε,1 − ε) = (0,1), and σ∗ is the standard deviation of the
compliance when (ε,1−ε) = (1,0). µ∗ and σ∗ have to be cal-
culated on the same set of input parameters except ε, under
which they are the maximum values of the mean and stan-

Coding the algorithm demands concrete values of ev-
ery parameter, many of which are shared between the two
examples. The finite element mesh in both examples is as-
sembled from square, linear, plane stress elements, whose
side length and thickness are unit dimension. Those ele-
ments are made of an isotropic, linear elastic material with
Poisson's ratio ν = 0.3. The material Young's modulus
is assumed to be a centered, mean-square Gaussian ran-
dom field with known covariance function as in (12), ex-
panded into a series of independent, standard normal ran-
dom variables [99]. The correlation lengths are chosen as
l1 = l2 = 0.6, and only the first two eigenvalues and eigen-
functions are picked for the truncated KL expansion. A wide
range of optimization algorithms for reliability analysis is
available in the CODES toolbox [93], including the Hybrid
Mean Value method selected for the examples due to its ef-
ficiency [100]. Other parameters of the optimization prob-
lem (22) are the target reliability levels β = {1.0,2.0,3.0},

weighting factors ε = {1,0.9,0.8,0.5,0.2,0}, and the ma-
terial property limits (a,b) = (1,1.5). Due to iterative na-
ture of MMA and SORA, several convergence criteria are
enforced. The MMA optimizer stops when the maximum
difference of design variables of two consecutive iterations
max ≤ 0.001), or the
is smaller than a prescribed value (dMMA
number of iterations is more than nMMA = 200. The sim-
ilar conditions are applied in the SORA loops, but for the
max ≤ 0.001) and a different maximum allowable
MPPs (dMPP
number of iterations (nSORA = 20). The level of sparse grid
approximation is 4 using Gauss-Hermite quadrature as the
base one-dimensional rule.
In SIMP, the minimum length
scale rmin = 1.5 and penalization factor p = 3 are used. Each
example is then validated by 50000 Monte Carlo simulations
(MCS), which compute failure probabilities of the limit state
function, and the mean and standard deviation of the compli-
ance. The examples are implemented in Matlab using Latin
hypercube sampling for MCS with seed 0. Those probabil-
ities are compared with values calculated from the three re-
liability levels, while statistical moments of the compliance
prove robustness of the optimization results against uncer-
tainty.

4.1 The Cantilever Beam

Fig. 2. The cantilever beam

Fig. 2 displays the cantilever beam, a two-dimensional
domain used in this example. The beam is fixed on its left
side, meshed into 60 × 20 elements, and subject to two unit
vertical loads, which are placed on its bottom edge at equal
distances (points A and B). The optimization problem is set
up as in (22), in which the minimum allowable displacement
at the load application point B is given as u0 = 220. Then our
proposed algorithm is tested on the example with different
values of target reliability, material parameters and weight-
ing factors. The 18 optimized designs are presented in Tables
1 and 2. The MCS and SRSM utilize those designs to calcu-
late the mean and standard deviation of vertical displacement
of point B (µB and σB in Table 3), as well as the probabili-
ties of failure event Pf = P [g(ρρρ,y) < 0] to show the reliabil-
ity levels achieved by the designs. Moreover, the mean and
standard deviation of the compliance are also obtained from
the MCS (µ[C] and σ[C] in Table 3) to examine how they
vary with respect to the weighting factors ε. All of theses
values are gathered in Table 3, whose second column shows

expected failure probabilities Pf = Φ(−β). Some conclu-
sions from this example results can be found in Section 5.

4.2 The L-shaped Beam

Fig. 3. The L-shaped beam

The second numerical example to illustrate our proposed
algorithm is the L-shaped beam as shown in Fig. 3. The
beam is fixed on its topmost edge and subject to two unit
vertical loads on its bottom edge−one at the right endpoint
B and the other at point A located one quarter of the bot-
tom edge length from point B. As in the previous example,
the weighted sum of the two statistical moments of the com-
pliance is minimized, while a probabilistic constraint is im-
posed on the vertical displacement of one load application
point (point B in Fig. 3) to design for flexibility. The mini-
mum allowable vertical displacement of point B is chosen as
u0 = 130. The design domain is discretized using a 60× 60
mesh of finite elements, and then one quarter of the mesh is
removed to make the domain L-shaped by forcing the ele-
ment densities in this region to be 0.001 before proceeding
to the next operation. The larger mesh used in this exam-
ples results in much longer running time based on our ex-
periments on the same computer. The results also exhibit the
same trends as in the previous example. Therefore, instead of
running the complete set of 18 combinations, only 12 cases,
which are the combinations of β = {1,3}, six weighting fac-
tors, and (a,b) = (1,1.5), are considered. Table 6 shows the
probabilities of displacement constraint violation Pf at point
B, the statistical moments of that point's vertical displace-
ment (µB and σB) calculated from both the MCS and SRSM,
and the mean and standard deviation of the compliance (µ[C]
and σ[C]). The L-shaped optimized designs are analyzed for
insights in the next section.

examples for comparison, verification, and insights.

largely an untouched topic in TO research, which, in our
opinion, is curious because topology is all about geometry
and "appearance" of structures. Without such tools, the best
effort is to compare those results qualitatively. To make their
differences more pronounced, readers may render them into
short animations, which would reveal much more than hu-
man eyes can perceive using only static images. There would
be subtle material re-distributions (i.e., among results under
the same tuple (ε,1−ε)), as well as thickening or thinning of
certain features, which could be almost undetectable by com-
paring static images. The removal or addition of features is
easier to spot among results. The most distinct results corre-
spond to ε = 1 and ε = 0, which is understandable because
they are the extreme cases. The results between them are sort
of transitions from one bounding value to the other.

A number of trends can be observed from both the opti-

mized designs and their corresponding numerical results:

1. The MCS-based Pf is always smaller than the expected
Pf , which confirms that the designs have achieved the
desired reliability level.

2. Decreasing ε, or increasing the weight on standard de-
viation in the robust objective, makes the MCS-based
Pf smaller until reaching 0. We hypothesize that there
are two classes of solutions depending on the weight:
one on the constraint boundary and the other inside the
feasible region of the optimization problem. In the first
class, the MCS-based Pf
is close to the expected Pf :
decreasing rate of the MCS-based Pf is very slow for
certain range of ε (i.e., ε = {1,0.9,0.8} in Table 3, and
ε = {1,0.9} in Table 6).

lutions are away from the constraint boundary but still
inside the feasible region: the decreasing rate acceler-
ates and the MCS-based Pf eventually becomes 0 (i.e.,
ε ≥ 0.5 in Table 3, and ε ≥ 0.8 in Table 6).

3. From our understanding of robust optimization, increas-
ing the weight on standard deviation in a minimization
problem will decrease its value and have the opposite ef-
fect on the mean, which is actually the case as observed
in Tables 3 and 6. However, there are a couple of out-
liers to this trend (i.e., (ε,β) = (0.8,2) in Table 3, and
ε = 0.9 in Table 6). An explanation can be made by in-
vestigating where the solution converges in the design
space. When the solutions are away from the constraint
boundary, the robust objective is more dominant in the
solution: a marked increase and decrease of the mean
and standard deviation, respectively, is observed. In so-
lutions at the constraint limit, the robust objective has
less in the solution.
This trend explains the decreasing tendency of the MCS-
based Pf . Increasing the weight on standard deviation
leads to decreased influence of the mean compliance,
whose major proportion is contributed by the displace-
ment of point B (Fig. 2 and 3) which is constrained prob-
abilistically in (22) to be larger than the minimum al-
lowable value u0. This results in increasing the mean of
point B displacement, whose changing rate is slow for
solutions close to constraint boundary and much more

rapid in the remaining cases (i.e., the sixth column of
Tables 3 and 6). The bigger the displacement of point B
becomes, the smaller the MCS-based Pf is.
It is ob-
vious that under a specific set of inputs (i.e., loading
and boundary conditions, material property) mechani-
cal capabilities of a structure (i.e., stress, strain, dis-
placement), even if heavily optimized, are always finite.
Thus, the MCS-based Pf approaches 0 when the dis-
placement of point B continues to increase.

4. The Smolyak-type sparse grid and the SRSM are both
very good methods for their respective approximating
targets. As shown in Tables 3 and 6, approximately
six significant digits are required to see the differences
between the MCS-based and the SRSM results. The
cumulative distribution functions of point B displace-
ment from the two methods are also almost identi-
cal, so they are not included in the paper. This also
makes us confident in choosing only two terms in the
KL expansion−adding more terms would only increase
computational cost without clear benefits. The same ob-
servation is applied to the Smolyak-type sparse grid and
MCS-based results of the mean and standard deviation
of the compliance. Because of such agreement, we de-
cide to use only one level of the sparse grid. Multiple
levels were tested in [17, 27].

6 Conclusions

In this paper, we have presented an efficient robust
reliability-based design approach for topology optimized de-
signs, considering random field uncertainty in material prop-
erty. Our approach avoids a double-loop approach to reliabil-
ity evaluation, and utilizes a number of techniques to reduce
computational cost without sacrificing solution accuracy.
The two case studies have demonstrated the methodology,
and have shown the impact of using the robust reliability-
based design approach. As shown in the case studies, the
topology can converge to a (local) solution where either the
reliability-based constraint or the robust objective has more
influence upon the resulting topology. This difference in
converged solution is determined by the relative weight of
the mean versus the variance in the robust objective. This
finding is significant to designers because it shows that us-
ing either exclusively a robust design approach or reliability-
based design approach will not identify the optimal topology
considering material property uncertainty. Only the robust
reliability-based design approach is capable of identifying
the optimal topology considering the influence of material
property uncertainty in both the objective and the constraint.
Explicitly considering material property uncertainty will
be significant in design for additive manufacturing, where
the additive process can lead to significant material property
uncertainty due to temperature gradients or other sources of
variation.
In terms of future work, the following are rec-
ommended. Further case studies should be considered to
better understand the interplay between the reliability con-
straint and the robust objective. Different objectives and con-
straints can be considered as well. Considering topology op-
timization as a tool for design for additive manufacturing,
another significant characteristic of the material property is
non-linearity. Polymeric materials used in additive manu-
facturing will be better modeled as hyper-elastic or visco-
elastic, as opposed to linear elastic. Another need is visu-
alization of the results. As noted in the text, it can be dif-
ficult to understand the differences in topology based upon
visual inspection. A more systematic comparison of differ-
ent converged results will help researchers better understand
the differences in designs resulting from different problem
formulations, and will lead to a better understanding of the
design principles leading to robust, reliable designs.
