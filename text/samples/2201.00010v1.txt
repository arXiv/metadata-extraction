Abstract

We explicitly prove that the transfer matrix of a finite layered P T -symmetric system of fix
length L consisting of N units of the potential system '+iV ' and '−iV ' of equal thickness
becomes a unit matrix in the limit N → ∞. This result is true for waves of arbitrary
wave vector k. This shows that in this limit, the transmission coefficient is always unity
while the reflection amplitude is zero for all waves traversing this length L. Therefore, a
free space of finite length L can be represented as a P T -symmetric medium.

Introduction

Around two decades ago, it was discovered that certain class of non-Hermitian Hamil-
tonian can support real energy eigen values provided the Hamiltonian is invariant under
a combine parity (P) and time-reversal (T) operation [1]. It was also noted that that a
fully consistent quantum theory can be developed for non-Hermitian system in a modi-
fied Hilbert space through the modification of inner product which restore the equivalent
Hermiticity and the unitary time evolution of the system[2, 3]. Since then a new dimen-
sion in quantum mechanics has emerged known as P T -symmetric quantum mechanics [4].
The non-Hermitian Hamiltonian display several new features which are originally absent
in Hermitian Hamiltonians. The important features are exceptional points (EPs) [5, 6],
spectral singularity (SS) [7]-[10], coherent perfect absorption (CPA) [10]-[15], critical cou-
pling (CC) [16]-[19] and CPA-laser [20]. Others notable features are invisibility [21, 22, 23]
and reciprocity [24]. CPA and SS have also been studied in the context of non-Hermitian
space fractional quantum mechanics [25]. Phenomena of SS have also been studied in the
domain of quaternionic quantum mechanics [26].

A quantum vacuum has fluctuations due to particle and anti-particle creations and
annihilations in such a way that creations and annihilations balances each other to keep
the net charge neutrality of the vacuum.
In a sufficiently small time interval, a snap
shot of the vacuum will contain equal number of particle/anti-particles pairs or waves of
complex frequencies having positive and negatives components of imaginary part. If the
creation and annihilation of the particles are respectively 'gain' and 'loss' component for
the vacuum system (and vice-versa for anti-particles), then the snap shot of the vacuum
will be a P T -symmetric system. In other words quantum vacuum is stable under P T -
symmetry.

Our motivation for the present work arises due to the arguments presented in the
above paragraph.
In order to check that whether vacuum can be represented as P T -
symmetric system, we consider a finite layered P T -symmetric system of fix length L
consisting of N units of the potential systems '+iV ' and '−iV ' of equal thickness 'b'
without any intervening gap between the individual potential systems. It is shown that
in the limit N → ∞ such that 2N b = L, the entire P T -symmetric system of finite length
L is equivalent to an empty space of length L in all aspect. We prove this by showing
that the transfer matrix of our P T -symmetric system of length L is a unit matrix in the
above limiting case for particles of any wave vector k incident on this system.

We organize the paper as follows: In section 2 we briefly discuss the transfer matrix for
one dimensional scattering. In section 3 we calculate the transfer matrix for our layered
P T -symmetric system and evaluate the limiting case N → ∞ of the finite length P T -
symmetric medium in section 4. We present results and associated discussion in section
5.

2 Transfer matrix

The Hamiltonian operator in one dimension for a non-relativistic particle is (in the unit
 = 1 and 2m = 1)

where V (x) ∈ C . V (x) → 0 as x → ±∞. If(cid:82) U (x)dx, where U (x) = (1 + x)V (x) is

dx2 + V (x),

H = − d2

(1)

finite over all x, then the Hamiltonian given above admits a scattering solution with the
following asymptotic values

ψ(k, x → +∞) = A+(k)eikx + B+(k)e−ikx,
ψ(k, x → −∞) = A−(k)eikx + B−(k)e−ikx.

(2)
(3)
The coefficients A±, B± are connected through a 2× 2 matrix M , called as transfer matrix
as given below,

(cid:18)A+(k)

B+(k)

B−(k)

M21(k) M22(k)

Where,

M (k) =

(5)

With the knowledge of the transfer matrix M (k), the transmission and reflection coeffi-
cient are obtained as,

tl(k) =

1

M22(k)

= tr(k), rl(k) = − M12
M22(k)

, rr(k) =

M21

M22(k)

.

(6)

The transfer matrix shows composition property.
If the transfer matrix for two non-
overlapping finite scattering regions V1 and V2 , where V1 is to the left of V2, are M1 and
M2 respectively, then the net transfer matrix Mnet of the whole system (V1 and V2) is

Mnet = M2.M1 .

(7)

The composition result can be generalized for arbitrary numbers of non-overlapping fi-
nite scattering regions. Knowing the transfer matrix, one easily compute the scattering
coefficients by using Eq. 6. From Eq. 6, it is also seen that if the diagonal elements
are unity and off-diagonal elements are zero, then we always have tl(k) = 1 = tr(k) and
rl(k) = 0 = rr(k). This case of transfer matrix represent empty space.

In the above equations, U± = k

obtain the following transfer matrix for the layered P T -symmetric system,

TN (ξ) and UN (ξ) are the Chebyshev polynomials of first and second kind respectively.
L = 2N b is the net spatial extent of the layered P T -symmetric system.

4 Special case of layered P T -symmetric medium

In this section we show that a finite length L of our layered P T -symmetric system con-
sisting infinitely many cells is analogous to an empty one dimensional space of length L.
To show this we take limiting case N → ∞ of each elements of transfer matrix 24 such
that b = L
2N where L is fixed (and is finite). Various steps of the calculations are discussed
below.

The limiting of case of ξ and χ in the leading order of L can be shown to be,

N→∞ ξ = 1 − (kL)2
2N 2 ,

N→∞ χ =

In arriving at the above limit, we have used b = L
With the above limiting value of ξ, we also evaluate

2N . We also observe limN→∞ ξ < 1.

N→∞ cos−1 ξ =

(15)

It is further known that for ε < 1, one can express TN (ε) = cos (N cos−1 ε). Therefore,

N→∞ TN (ξ) = cos (N cos−1 ξ).

lim

Using Eq. 15 in the above, we find

lim
N→∞ TN (ξ) = cos kL.

(16)

Next we evaluate the limiting value of Chebyshev polynomial of second kind for the
present problem. We use the following identity,

UN−1(ξ) =

sin (N cos−1 ξ)
sin (cos−1 ξ)

.

Using Eq. 15 in the above, the limiting value is given by,

N→∞ UN−1(ξ) =
lim

sin kL
sin kL
N

.

From the above result, we arrive at

N→∞ χUN−1(ξ) = sin kL.
lim

(17)

(18)

In the above we have used limN→∞ sin kL
and Eq. 18 we have the following results,

N = kL

N Combining the limiting values of Eq. 16

N→∞ TN (ξ) ± iχUN−1(ξ) = e±ikL.

lim

(19)

Using Eq. 19 in the diagonal values of transfer matrix (Eq. 24) we obtain

(20)
i.e. the diagonal elements are unity in the limit N → ∞ provided the support L is finite.
Now we evaluate the limiting values of off-diagonal terms of the transfer matrix. The
limiting value of η ± τ in the leading order of b is,

lim
N→∞ Ω11 = 1 = lim

N→∞ Ω22,

N→∞(η ± τ ) = V b2.

lim

Using Eq.17 it can be easily shown that,

N→∞(η ± τ )UN−1(ξ) =

lim

V b
2k

sin kL = 0.

Therefore, the off-diagonal terms of the transfer matrix (Eq. 24) are zero, i.e.,

lim
N→∞ Ω12 = 0 = lim

N→∞ Ω21,

and therefore transmission coefficient is always unity and reflection coefficient is always
zero for all wave number k in the limit N → ∞. Fig 3 shows the plot of transmission
amplitude T (N, k) as a function of N and k for V = 40 and L = 1. It is seen from the
figure that transmission amplitude is unity for large N as proven theoretically. The range
of N in the figure is taken from 500 to 2000.

This is to be noted that when P T -symmetry is not respected, the vacuum configuration
is not obtained. If one take the general case where the potential +iV is replaced by V1+iV2
and potential −iV with V1 − iεV2, {V1, V2} ∈ R, the net configuration of length L in the
limit N → ∞ corresponds to a barrier potential of height V1 + i(1 − ε)V2 and length L.
When P T -symmetry is respected (ε = 1), the limiting case N → ∞ correspond to a real
barrier of height V1 and length L. The case presented in this letter is the special case
V1 = 0, ε = 1. The calculations for the more general case is much lengthy and is planned
to be reported elsewhere.

5 Results and Discussions

We have shown that a finite layered P T -symmetric system of fix length L consisting of
N units of adjacently arranged 'unit cell' P T -symmetric system represent a free space
of length L in the limit N → ∞ at all wave number k. The 'unit cell' P T -symmetric
system is made by potential '+iV ' and '−iV ' ( V ∈ R+ ), of same thickness and arranged
adjacently without an intervening gap. This is proven by showing that the transfer matrix
of such a layered P T -symmetric system over fix length L is a unity matrix at all wave
number k for large number of unit cells. Therefore for such a system in this limit, the
transmission coefficient is always unity while the reflection coefficient is always zero. Thus
a free space of finite length L can be represented as P T -symmetric medium. The result
is also shown numerically for transmission coefficient.

It is to be noted that in the present case of the layered P T -symmetric system, the
effect of gain (+iV ) and loss part (−iV ) cancel each other in the limit b → 0 (or N →
∞ for the present problem) as the wave traverses through it. This case is different
than considering vanishing strength of balanced gain and loss component of the non-
Hermitian potential. The present results shows that vacuum can be represented as the
special case of P T -symmetric medium. More investigations are needed to understand the
significant of this result. This finite P T -symmetric system for large L is also invisible for
left and right incidence. If particle production is represented as +iV (the gain part) and
particle annihilation is represented as −iV (the lossy part), then the present limiting case
of layered P T -symmetric medium represent the static snap shot of vacuum fluctuation.
However it will be worth investigating the nature of transfer matrix when the height
of each 'unit cell' is oscillatory in nature where frequency of oscillation is different for
different cells. This may represent a more realistic picture of vacuum fluctuation when
represented in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics.
