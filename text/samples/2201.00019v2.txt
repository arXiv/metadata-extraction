Abstract: We describe a proposal to add a set of very forward detectors to the CMS
experiment for the high-luminosity era of the Large Hadron Collider to search for beyond the
standard model long-lived particles, such as dark photons, heavy neutral leptons, axion-like
particles, and dark Higgs bosons. The proposed subsystem is called FACET for Forward-
Aperture CMS ExTension, and will be sensitive to any particles that can penetrate at
least 50 m of magnetized iron and decay in an 18 m long, 1 m diameter vacuum pipe. The
decay products will be measured in detectors using identical technology to the planned
CMS Phase-2 upgrade.

The existence of long-lived particles (LLPs), i.e., particles with the proper lifetime cτ in
a macroscopic range, is predicted in many models of physics beyond the standard model
(BSM). Generally, LLPs are naturally expected in models with small mass splittings be-
tween the adjacent states (e.g., in supersymmetric models) or with suppressed couplings
to standard model (SM) particles. In particular, LLPs are often present in particle dark
matter (DM) models, where they serve as portals between the DM and SM particles. The
existence of DM is well established from astronomical observations and cosmology. It is
generally assumed that DM consists of BSM particles . While searches for such particles in
the TeV mass range continue at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the possibility
that new particles may be relatively light ((cid:46)50 GeV), and yet have escaped detection so
far because of very weak coupling to SM particles, is receiving considerable attention, as
discussed in, e.g., refs. [1 -- 3]. There are many possible so-called portals; these are neutral
particles that couple weakly to the SM and also to DM particles (but being unstable are
not themselves DM candidates), such as dark photons [4 -- 6], heavy neutral leptons [7, 8],
axion-like particles [9 -- 11], and scalars or dark Higgs particles [12, 13].

The proposed new CMS subsystem, FACET (Forward-Aperture CMS ExTension), can
search for many such LLPs (called here X 0), depending only on their forward production
cross section, momentum, mass mX 0, and proper lifetime cτ. We will show that FACET

 --  1  -- 

covers a region of parameter space not accessible to other experiments, neither existing nor
proposed.

In what follows, we will use the CMS detector right-handed coordinate system [14],
with the origin at the CMS interaction point (IP5), with the z axis pointing in the coun-
terclockwise proton beam direction, the y axis pointing upward, and the x axis pointing
toward the center of the LHC ring. The polar angle θ is measured with respect to the z
axis and the pseudorapidity η is defined as − ln[tan(θ/2)].
Low-mass particles typically imply production peaking in the forward direction. How-
ever, even decay products of a 125 GeV Higgs boson (H(125)) can have small enough polar
angle θ to reach FACET [15]. Small couplings often imply long lifetimes, hence the focus
on searches for LLPs that can manifest as displaced vertices, e.g., in the large central de-
tectors at the LHC. Fixed-target experiments, such as NA62 [16, 17] at the CERN SPS,
have sensitivity for LLPs with mass less than 1 GeV from π0, η, and η(cid:48) meson decays.

Longer lifetimes can be probed in the LHC Run 3 by the FASER experiment [18, 19]
in the beam direction (θ = 0◦) at a distance z = 480 m from the ATLAS interaction
point (IP1) and by the SND@LHC [20] experiment located on the opposite side of IP1, as
well as in a more central region by the MilliQan experiment [21], located near the CMS
detector and MoEDAL-MALL/MAPP experiment [22, 23] located at the LHCb interaction
point IP8. There are several proposed high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) era experiments
targeting LLP searches, such as MATHUSLA [24, 25], CODEX-b [26], FASER-2 [27, 28],
ANUBIS [29], FORMOSA [30]; as well as SHADOWS [31], a beam-dump experiment at the
CERN SPS. There are also experimental proposals outside CERN, such as SUBMET [32]
at J-PARC and LUXE [33] at the DESY XFEL facility.

FACET is not proposed to be a new experiment, but a new subsystem of the CMS
experiment that, while overlapping in the parameter space with other searches, will cover
an extended and unique region. FACET will be sensitive to particles produced with polar
angles 1 < θ < 4 mrad (equivalently 7.6 > η > 6.2).
It is closer to IP5 than FASER
(FASER-2) is to IP1, with four hundred (four) times the solid angle. Conceptually, the
FACET detector location is somewhat similar to that of the FASER "near detector" option
discussed in ref. [18] and later dropped from consideration. FACET differs in many aspects
from the FASER near detector idea, as it is conceptually designed to cope with large
backgrounds and radiation exposure at low polar angles with respect to the beamline,
which rendered the FASER "near detector" not a viable option.

FACET has an 18 m long decay volume from z = 101 to 119 m, followed by an 8 m
long region instrumented with various particle detectors. FACET covers a range of proper
lifetimes cτ of ∼0.1 -- 100 m. We note that the Lorentz factor γ is typically high in the
forward direction. A unique feature among the LHC experiments is that the decay volume
is at high vacuum (LHC quality, as it is part of the LHC beam pipe), eliminating any
background from particle interactions inside a ∼14 m3 fiducial region.
Small couplings also imply the ability of an LLP to penetrate a large amount of ab-
sorbing material. Between IP5 and the decay volume LLPs have to penetrate 35 -- 50 m
(200 -- 300 λint) of magnetized iron in the LHC quadrupole magnets Q1 -- Q3 and the new (for
Run 4) 35 T·m superconducting dipole D1. Since neutrinos are the only SM particles that

 --  2  -- 

can penetrate that much absorber, essentially all the SM backgrounds having direct paths
from the IP are eliminated. Nevertheless, the detectors are in a region with high radiation
levels and particle showers from upstream interactions in the beam pipe and surrounding
material. The design of FACET takes these challenges into account.

2 FACET as a New Subsystem of CMS

A schematic view of the detector is shown in Fig. 1. The project requires that an 18 m long
section of the LHC beam pipe, between z = 101 and 119 m on one side of the IP5 interaction
region be replaced with a circular pipe of a 50 cm radius1. This section is downstream of the
focusing quadrupole magnets and beam separation dipole magnet D1. Additional shielding
will be placed upstream of the first detector, which is a two-layer counter hodoscope made
of radiation-hard quartz pads. The hodoscope must have very high efficiency to tag charged
particles from interactions in the upstream shielding, most of which have large enough polar
angles to miss the tracker. A preliminary design has about 1500 quartz pads of size 2×2 cm2
arranged in two overlapping planes to avoid cracks. The occupancy per bunch crossing will
be (cid:46)10%, with the efficiency for charged particles >99.99%.

Dedicated fluka [34, 35] simulation predicts that with the present design there will be
∼30 charged particles in the tracker per bunch crossing. These are nearly all background
tracks, which are detected in the hodoscope or seen to originate from the upstream beam
pipe and ignored in the subsequent analysis. The fluka simulation also predicts that
there will be, on average, one neutral hadron (mostly K0 or Λ) decaying inside the decay
volume. All bunch crossings will be examined for candidate decays inside the vacuum
volume, giving a sensitivity to an integrated luminosity of ∼3 ab−1 in the high-luminosity
LHC era. The highly segmented upstream hodoscope, precision tracking, and imaging
calorimetry will reduce these backgrounds to very low levels, even eliminating them in some
channels, as discussed below. In addition, we are investigating the possibility to further
mitigate these backgrounds by installing additional shielding closer to the D1 dipole and
possibly shortening the vacuum decay volume by 1 -- 2 m to make space for more shielding,
and possibly a magnetized iron toroid, in front of the hodoscope.

On both ends of the enlarged beam pipe, where it transitions from R = 10.6 to 50 cm
(front) and from 50 to 12.5 cm (back), are thin (∼2 mm) aluminum convex caps to minimize
multiple scattering of charged particles. The convex windows also mitigate the impedance
mismatch. Behind the downstream cap (in air) precision tracking, high-granularity elec-
tromagnetic and hadron calorimetry, and a toroidal magnet interspersed with tracking
detectors measure charged-particle tracks and identify and measure the energies of pho-
tons, electrons, hadrons, and muons. There is no magnetic field between the X 0 decay and
the precision tracker, making accurate reconstruction of decay vertices simple. A layer of
fast timing with low-gain avalanche detectors will be included. This high-resolution tim-
ing, with σt ∼ 30 ps, will provide vertex positioning in 4D (x, y, z, t) and a time-of-flight
measurement for charged particles. These will be used to reject backgrounds from pairs
of tracks from independent collisions within the same bunch crossing, which have a time

1A large beam pipe with a similar radius already exists downstream of the ALICE experiment.

essentially the same since it is azimuthally symmetric. Upstream (to the left) is the IP5 collision
region (at z = 0) followed by the machine elements Q1 -- Q3 and D1 comprising 35 -- 50 m of iron
shielding. The superimposed red dashed line shows schematically an LLP from the IP5 decaying into
two charged tracks shown in blue. The TAXN copper absorber is conceived to intercept the neutral
particles produced at the interaction point at the HL-LHC, in order to shield the superconducting
magnets downstream. Its location limits the extent of FACET in the z direction.

spread of ∼200 ps. While this spread limits our ability to perform the mass measurement
using time-of-flight plus energy information for the LLP candidates, this information still
provides an added constraint. For example, a particle with a mass mX = 5 GeV and mo-
mentum p = 100 GeV has a time-of-flight from the IP5, which is ∼500 ps longer than for
a particle with β = 1.
The tracking is followed by electromagnetic and hadron calorimetry, using identical
technology to the CMS HGCAL (High-Granularity Calorimeter) [36] planned for the for-
ward direction in the CMS Phase-2 upgrade. Copper or tungsten plates interspersed with
silicon pads provide imaging in 4D. The high granularity is important to measure indi-
vidual showers above a threshold energy (e.g., 10 GeV, but tunable) and their directions
in the presence of many low-energy showers. Behind the calorimeter, an iron toroid with
magnetic field of B ∼ 1.75 T instrumented with additional silicon tracking measures the
charge of muons and allows an approximate measurement of the muon momentum and the
dimuon mass for any muon pairs. Muons are also detected through the active layers of the
calorimeter.

A dedicated Geant4 [37] model of the FACET detector is being built, which would
allow us to study the backgrounds in much more detail than in the present initial paper.
Nevertheless, most of the detector performance characteristics have been already obtained
using fast parametric simulation. In particular, for LLPs decaying into a pair of charged
particles, we expect the decay vertex position resolution in the z direction from the tracking
(5 planes of 100 µm silicon strip sensors with a typical hit position resolution of 30 µm) to be
∼5 cm, which would allow ensuring the vertex to be located within the decay pipe without

For photons, the pointing resolution in θ achievable
with the HGCAL technology is σθ/θ ∼ 2.5% [36], which translates into the decay vertex
z position resolution of about 15 cm. Moreover, by combining the energy information
from the calorimeter and pointing information from the tracker, one could achieve a mass
resolution of ∼5% for LLPs decaying to a pair of hadrons or a pair of electrons. Similar,
but slightly worse mass resolution (∼8%) can be also achieved for the dimuon decay by
combining the information from the tracker and the muon toroidal detector. This level of
performance would provide excellent handles in suppressing various backgrounds, discussed
in more detail in section 5.

The approximate number of channels in the FACET detector amounts to about 5% of
that for the CMS Phase-2 upgrade, making the detector relatively inexpensive, as most of it
could be built using the same modules as will be used for the central CMS detector upgrade,
thus minimizing the R&D and engineering needs. Based on detailed fluka simulations,
the radiation dose for the inner parts of the FACET detector is expected to be similar
to that in the central CMS, so the choice of the CMS radiation-hard technology would
allow the detector to withstand harsh radiation conditions at the HL-LHC without the
necessity to replace the detector components, perhaps with the exception of the inner part
of the forward hodoscope, which is easily accessible and could be replaced. While fluka
simulations are a standard tool to estimate the radiation doses at the LHC, we also plan
to measure the radiation background with dedicated sensors near the proposed FACET
location during the forthcoming LHC Run 3, provided that we obtain the LHC approval
for these measurements.

3 Sensitivity to Long-Lived Particles

The reach in LLP parameter space has been calculated for dark photons, heavy neutral
leptons, axion-like particles, and dark Higgs bosons in several benchmark scenarios. Pre-
dictions are generally model dependent and some also depend on the nature of other BSM
particles, e.g., a heavy Z(cid:48) boson and its mass. We base these studies on a total integrated
luminosity of 3 ab−1 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy √s = 14 TeV,
with either 3 or 5 candidate events, assuming no background and that FACET can detect all
penetrating neutral particle decays to ≥ 2 charged particles or photons occurring between
101 < z < 119 m with the decay products within 18 < R < 50 cm at z = 120 m. The
typical momentum spectrum of LLPs coming from meson decays peaks at 100 -- 250 GeV,
with the median in the 200 -- 500 GeV range, depending on the LLP mass.

3.1 Dark Photons
Massive dark photons A(cid:48) are neutral gauge bosons, which are not directly charged under
SM gauge groups. However, they can interact with SM particles via mixing with photons.
A recent review can be found in ref. [5]. A massive virtual photon produced by any process
in a hadron-hadron collision has some probability of conversion to an A(cid:48), governed by the
kinetic mixing parameter . If mA(cid:48) (cid:46) 1 GeV, the most prolific source will be decays of π0,
η, and η(cid:48) mesons. The fluxes of these particles are highest at small polar angles.

Figure 2. FACET reach for dark photons (3 event contours) in a generic model with no BSM
sources, as calculated with Foresee [38]. Existing bounds (gray shaded regions) are taken from
CHARM (following Ref. [39]), BaBar [39], E137 [40], LHCb [41], NuCal [42, 43], along with the
prospective limits taken from studies performed for Belle II [44], HPS [45, 46], LHCb [47, 48],
NA62 [49], SeaQuest [50], FASER-2 [38], and SHiP [51].

Fig. 2 shows limits calculated using the Foresee package [38] without assuming any
other BSM sources of dark photons, such as heavy Z(cid:48) bosons, which can extend the mass
range and require the energy of the LHC.
For mA(cid:48) > 1 GeV the main production mechanisms are: q + ¯q → A(cid:48) + X; Drell -- 
Yan: q + ¯q → A(cid:48); bremsstrahlung: p → A(cid:48) + p and q → A(cid:48) + q; and heavy-quark decays:
c → A(cid:48) + X, b → A(cid:48) + X. The decay modes to SM particles of a minimal dark photon are
the same as the final states in e+e−
A comparison of the reach of FACET and other experiments for dark photons in all final
states in the model of ref. [52] is given in figure 3 (left). In this model, the main production
mechanism of dark photons is via radiation in a rather rich hidden sector, which contains
a Dirac fermion ψ and two gauge bosons, which mix with the SM weak hypercharge field
Bµ. FACET covers a unique region of the mixing parameter 1 vs. mass (or alternatively
lifetime vs. mass) phase space. Figure 3 (right) shows the number of events as a function of
lifetime cτ for three A(cid:48) masses for the model parameters corresponding to the reach shown
in figure 3 (left).

→ γ∗ at √s = mA(cid:48).

Our reach estimates do not include dark photons that are created in hadronic showers,

e.g., from π0 and η meson decays in the iron absorber, and are therefore conservative.

photon events as a function of cτ for mA(cid:48) = 2, 4, and 10 GeV in this model.

3.2 Heavy Neutral Leptons
Many extensions of the SM involve heavy right-handed neutrinos or heavy neutral leptons
Ni (where the subscript i indicates flavor), which may explain the light neutrino masses
through the seesaw mechanism [8, 53, 54].

These particles may be produced in any kinematically allowed SM weak leptonic decay,
e.g., of s, c, b, t quarks, or W or Z bosons. We consider a specific extension of the SM [55],
with a Z(cid:48) boson (which can be light and yet have escaped detection due to the small coupling
to SM particles) and three heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos Ni. In this model, the
decay Z(cid:48)
→ NiNi is allowed, and the Ni can be long-lived and decay to SM particles,
e.g., a lepton of the same flavor and a virtual W ∗ or Z∗ boson. For the Z(cid:48) masses in the
10 -- 100 GeV range, most interesting in this model, the branching fraction of the Z(cid:48)
→ NiNi
decays amounts to about 20%, i.e., rather large and similar to that for the Z boson decays
into SM neutrinos.

Fig. 4 shows the coverage in the mixing parameter VµN vs. mN plane in the case of a
single Majorana neutrino N mixed with a muon neutrino. In this case, FACET has a unique
sensitivity at high masses, above ∼15 GeV for lifetimes cτ between ∼0.1 and ∼100 m.
3.3 Axion-Like Particles
Pseudoscalar particles, such as extremely light axions, were initially proposed to solve the
strong-CP problem of QCD. More massive axion-like particles (ALPs, a) may exist, and
if produced at the LHC [11, 61], they may decay with long lifetimes into photon pairs (or
γe+e−) or lepton pairs, after penetrating thick absorbers. FACET will be well-placed to
discover such ALPs in certain regions of their mass and the coupling to SM gauge bosons.

mH for a range of mixing angles. FACET and FASER-2 contours are calculated with Foresee [38].
Current exclusions from LHCb [62, 63] are shown as gray shaded regions. Also, sensitivity from
studies for MATHUSLA [64], CODEX-b [65], LHCb upgrade [65], and SHiP [66] are shown.

3.4 Dark Higgs Bosons
The possible existence of a dark-sector partner φ of the 125 GeV Higgs boson has attracted
attention, as discussed, e.g., in refs. [12, 13, 67]. A dark Higgs field provides a simple
mechanism to give mass to the dark photon A(cid:48). The corresponding dark Higgs boson φ
may be the lightest dark sector state and can decay into SM particles via mixing with the
Higgs boson, governed by the mixing angle θ. Unitarity and perturbativity suggest that
the dark Higgs boson cannot be much heavier than the dark gauge boson A(cid:48), while it can
be significantly lighter. The dark Higgs boson can be very long-lived due to its suppressed
couplings to the accessible light SM states.

For mass ranges below ∼5 GeV the dominant production mechanism is through B
meson decays, e.g., B → K + φ, with φ decaying to pairs of most massive SM fermions
accessible kinematically, e.g., to a pair of muons for light φ, or to a pair of τ leptons or
charm quarks for a heavier φ. A heavier φ may also decay to another pair of new scalars,
s, which may in turn be LLPs.

The reach of FACET for a dark Higgs boson decaying to a detectable final state is given
in figure 6. In addition to the production via B meson decays (left plot), we also consider
the case of a small, non-zero trilinear coupling φφH between the SM Higgs and dark Higgs
bosons, resulting in a 2.5% branching fraction of the H(125) → φφ decay (right plot). This
value is lower than the projected limits on the BSM Higgs boson decay branching fraction at
the HL-LHC [68]. In this case, the low-mass reach is slightly improved compared to the case
with no trilinear coupling, as a new decay mode b → sφφ, where b and s are the bottom
and strange quarks, respectively, is present due to a virtual Higgs boson exchange [13].
However, the most striking feature in this model is that FACET offers a unique sensitivity

4 Triggers

As a part of the CMS Phase-2 Upgrade at the HL-LHC, the Level-1 (L1) trigger system will
be upgraded, with a latency increased to 12.5 µs and output rate to the High-Level Trigger
(HLT) increased to 750 kHz. The HLT will analyse the data with close to off-line perfor-
mance, sending data to long-term storage at a rate of about 7.5 kHz. FACET will provide
an additional external trigger to the CMS L1 Global Trigger, built from the hodoscope,
tracking, calorimeter, and muon detector information, and using the same hardware and
code to be used in the upgraded CMS detectors.

The L1 triggers will be formed from, among others:
1. ≥ 2 tracks with a small distance of closest approach inside a decay volume;
2. ≥ 2 muon tracks through the toroidal spectrometer;
3. ≥ 1 cluster of energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter above some threshold and

with a direction requirement based on the tracker and/or the calorimeter;

4. ≥ 1 cluster of energy in the hadron calorimeter above some threshold and with a

direction requirement based on the tracker.

To achieve maximum sensitivity for the LLP search, FACET will be exposed to all
bunch crossings. The goal of the trigger is to select all candidates for X 0 → ≥ 2 charged
tracks or two photons (even if merged), while excluding decays of the SM particles, such as
K0 and Λ.

The fluka [34, 35] code, regularly used for LHC background calculations, predicts
that there will be about 30 charged particles with the momentum above 1 GeV (mostly
protons, π±, and e±, with ∼1.9 µ±) entering the tracker at R > 18 cm per bunch crossing
(with a pileup of 140). These are all background tracks, and will be tagged as such by the
front hodoscope and ignored. The L1 track trigger will form tracks (at 119 < z < 122 m)
and calculate the position of candidate vertices inside the decay volume, as well as confirm
that the decay signature is consistent with an LLP originating at IP5.

Since the planned rate of L1 triggers for CMS is 750 kHz, FACET triggers at a L1 rate
of a few kHz is a goal, which should be achievable by tuning thresholds. The HLT can apply
selections close to the offline analysis to reduce the rate to long-term storage to (cid:46)100 Hz
out of 7.5 KHz total rate-to-tape for CMS. The FACET-triggered events will include the
full CMS data, and the FACET information will be included in all CMS triggered events.
The FACET data will be (cid:28) 1% of the full CMS data. The FACET trigger could also be
run in a standalone mode, with only FACET information saved, and without correlating
with the central CMS detector.

 --  10  -- 

For charged particles with θ < 1 mrad that come through the dipole D1 aperture, the
rates will be high, but some SM channels, e.g., e+e− and µ+µ−, are interesting and special
triggers for those can be included. Such triggers will be prescaled, but the data will be
useful for checks throughout the LHC running.

For any low-pileup LHC runs, with proton, as well as with ion beams, a different
set of triggers will be prepared. Since many bunch crossings will then have only a single
interaction, correlations between leading charged hadrons and the central event can be
studied.

5 Backgrounds

FACET is unique among all LHC LLP search proposals in having a very large volume of
LHC-quality vacuum for decays. Vertices with R > 15 cm inside a fiducial volume with two
or more associated tracks cannot have come from interactions; they must be due to decays2.
Our goal is to have no background events even with 3 ab−1 of integrated luminosity in many
decay channels; in which case even a few signal candidate events can mark a discovery.

Neutral hadrons of concern are K0

S, K0

The direct path from the collision region to the decay volume has 200 -- 300 λint (de-
pending on θ) of magnetized iron, effectively eliminating all SM particles, except neutrinos.
Therefore the only SM particles entering the decay volume are indirect, from interactions
in the beam pipe and LHC components. Most are at large enough polar angle θ to miss
the tracker, nevertheless the fluka code predicts that there will be about ∼30 charged
particles with the momentum above 1 GeV entering the tracker at R > 18 cm per bunch
crossing. There is a significantly larger flux of lower-momentum charged particles enter-
ing the hodoscope, most of which have large enough polar angles to miss the downstream
tracker. This drives the need for at least two layers of ∼2 × 2 cm2 pads in the hodoscope.
L, Λ, and Ξ0, with about one entering the decay
volume per bunch crossing. Their decay tracks will be well measured and their energies
determined in the calorimeter. A Monte Carlo simulation shows that the parent mass and
the direction can be reconstructed with this information. Requiring the parent track to
point back to the IP5 interaction region and using the decay position information (flat in
z for an LLP) will reduce this neutral-hadron background that may still be overwhelming
for X 0 → h+h− (where h± denotes charged hadrons) with mX 0 (cid:46) 0.8 GeV.
The situation is much better for lepton pairs. Only K0 decays can contribute; for
S either through both charged pions being misidentified as electrons or as muons, or by
K0
genuine dilepton decays, all of which have very small branching fractions < 10−8. The
L meson has common semileptonic decays to π±e∓νe and π±µ∓νe, so only one π± has
K0
to be misidentified as a lepton. The missing neutrino smears the pointing from IP5, the
reconstructed mass is a continuum with mX 0 < 500 MeV, and the z distribution of the
vertex is not nearly uniform as it would be for an LLP.
L → µ+µ−
decays in the vacuum volume given the branching fraction of 7 × 10−9. The µ+µ− mass

In 2×1015 bunch crossings (3 ab−1) we expect several thoU.S.A.nd true K0

is reconstructed and, if compatible with mK0, the momentum, the decay time cτ and
the total momentum are known. While it would be interesting (and an excellent control
measurement) to observe these rare K0 dilepton decays, they will not be a background to
X 0 → l+l− decays for mX 0 (cid:38) 0.6 GeV.
A potential background in the X 0 → l+l− channel is from pileup, with two muons
or electrons from different collisions in the same bunch crossing appearing to come from a
common vertex in the decay volume. Studies done with fluka show that the transverse dis-
tribution of muons is approximately proportional to 1/R, the density ranging from 2× 10−4
to 8 × 10−5 cm−2. The total is an average of 1.9 muons (both charges) per bunch crossing
within 18 < R < 50 cm. This background will be eliminated by charged-particle tagging
in the upstream hodoscope and precision vertexing. If the inefficiency of the hodoscope is
10−4 (10−5) there will be ∼107 (∼105) bunch crossings in 3 ab−1 with two or more untagged
muons entering the decay volume. A Monte Carlo study of pairs of uncorrelated muons was
used to determine the probability that any pair has a distance of closest approach < 60 µm;
the prediction is 150 (1.5) two-track vertices from pileup, which is further reduced by a fac-
tor of two by the opposite-sign track requirement. Further requiring the vector sum of the
muon momenta to point back to the IP5 interaction region eliminates this background.

A search for X 0 → γγ, e.g., for an axion-like particle, having no charged tracks and
less precise vertex location, will be challenging, with a large background from photons from
π0, η, and η(cid:48) meson decays, as well as from K0
S → π0π0 decays. The electromagnetic section
of the calorimeter measures both the shower directions and the distance of closest approach
of the two photons, albeit without the high precision which is achieved for tracks. Requiring
matching in x,y,z,t using position and timing information and that the momentum of the
diphoton pair points back to IP5 will suppress these backgrounds, especially for mγγ (cid:38)
1 GeV. Studies based on full detector simulation are under way to determine whether this
background could be controlled.

Many BSM particles with masses above about 1 GeV have decay modes to more than
two charged particles. The only SM hadrons that can decay to four charged particles inside
the FACET decay volume are K0, via the following decays: K0
L →
e+e−π+π−, K0
L → µ+µ−e+e−. With the expected K0 fluxes FACET
will detect such decays, but they will not constitute a background for 4-body decays with
mX 0 (cid:38) 0.6 GeV.

L → e+e−e+e−, and K0

S → e+e−π+π− , K0

We have also considered pileup of two unrelated neutral-hadron (e.g., K0

S, Λ) decays,
but to be a background to X 0 → 4 hadrons these decays must be superimposed in x,y,z,
consistent in time, and the apparent "parent" must point back to IP5. In addition, for some
of the signals we may veto pair masses compatible with that of a neutral K0 or Λ. These
requirements eliminate the background from pileup.

To summarize, while decays of neutral hadrons inside the vacuum volume will be a
major source of background for hadronic decays of LLPs with mX 0 (cid:46) 0.8 GeV, decays to
leptons and multihadrons at higher masses should have vanishing backgrounds even in 3
ab−1, thanks to 200 -- 300 λint of the iron absorber, the vacuum decay volume, high-precision
tracking, a high-granularity calorimeter, and muon momentum measurement in the toroidal
spectrometer.

6 Summary

FACET is proposed as a new subsystem for the CMS experiment in the high-luminosity LHC
era. The primary objective is to search for beyond the standard model long-lived particles
decaying in a large vacuum volume, during the high-luminosity LHC phase, corresponding
to an integrated luminosity of about 3 ab−1 of proton-proton collisions at √s = 14 TeV.
The FACET detector requires an enlarged beam pipe section between z = 101 and 119 m,
followed by high-precision tracking and calorimeter modules using identical technology to
the CMS Phase-2 upgrade. These are designed for the high-radiation environment expected
in the high-luminosity LHC era. The searches can be background-free in many channels,
especially for neutral long-lived particles with masses (cid:38)1 GeV. FACET will make an in-
clusive search for dark photons, heavy neutral leptons, axion-like particles, and dark Higgs
bosons with a sensitivity defined by their masses and couplings to standard model particles.
The couplings must be large enough to give a detectable production cross section in the
forward direction, and for the particles to decay to visible states, while small enough for the
particles to traverse 35 -- 50 m of iron upstream of the decay volume. FACET will explore a
unique area in the parameter space of mass and couplings, largely complementary to other
existing and proposed searches, yet with some overlap ensuring seamless coverage.
