Abstract -- Device activity detection and channel estimation for
massive grant-free access under frequency-selective fading have
unfortunately been an outstanding problem. This paper aims
to address the challenge. Specifically, we present an orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based massive grant-
free access scheme for a wideband system with one M -antenna
base station (BS), N single-antenna Internet of Things (IoT)
devices, and P channel
taps. We obtain two different but
equivalent models for the received pilot signals under frequency-
selective Rayleigh fading. Based on each model, we formulate
device activity detection as a non-convex maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) problem and propose an iterative algorithm
to obtain a stationary point using optimal techniques. The two
proposed MLE-based methods have the identical computational
complexity order O(N P L2), irrespective of M , and degrade to
the existing MLE-based device activity detection method when
P = 1. Conventional channel estimation methods can be readily
applied for channel estimation of detected active devices under
frequency-selective Rayleigh fading, based on one of the derived
models for the received pilot signals. Numerical results show
that the two proposed methods have different preferable system
parameters and complement each other to offer promising device
activity detection design for grant-free massive access under
frequency-selective Rayleigh fading.

I. INTRODUCTION

Driven by the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT),
massive machine-type communication (mMTC) plays a vital
role in the fifth generation (5G) cellular technologies and
beyond. It is incredibly challenging to support enormous IoT
devices which are energy-limited and sporadically active, and
have little data to send once activate. Massive grant-free access
with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has been recently
proposed to address the challenge. Specifically, devices are
pre-assigned specific non-orthogonal pilots, active devices
directly send their pilots, and the base station (BS) detects
the active devices and estimates their channel conditions from
the received signal of non-orthogonal pilots [1]. Unfortunately,
vast potential non-orthogonal pilots complicate the signal
processing at the BS.

Due to inherent sparse device activities in massive grant-free
access, joint device activity detection and channel estimation
can be formulated as compressed sensing (CS) problems and
solved by CS-based algorithms [2] -- [4]. Specifically, [2] pro-
poses an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm with

Development Program of China under Grant 2018YFB1801102 and in part

a minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation denoiser.
In [4], the authors propose an alternating direction method
of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm for GROUP LASSO
[3]. Besides, several works focus only on device activity
detection, as conventional channel estimation methods can
be directly applied for estimating channel conditions of the
detected active devices. For instance, [5] formulates device
activity detection as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
problem and proposes a coordinate descent method to obtain
a stationary point. This MLE-based method is also analyzed
in [5], [6]. Motivated by [5], [7] formulates device activity
detection with prior activity distribution as a maximum a
posteriori probability (MAP) estimation problem and extends
the coordinate descent method in [5] to obtain a stationary
point.

It is worth noting that all existing works [2], [4] -- [7] consider
massive grant-free access for a narrow band system under flat
fading. However, due to the signal corruption under frequency-
selective fading, the existing methods for activity detection
and channel estimation designed for a narrow band system
under flat fading are no longer applicable for a wideband
system under frequency-selective fading. On the other hand,
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) provides
a high degree of robustness against channel-frequency se-
lectivity. It hence is an attractive choice for 4G-LTE and
5G-NR. In this paper, we would like to shed some light
toward this direction. Specifically, we present an orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based massive grant-
free access scheme with one M -antenna BS, N single-antenna
IoT devices, and P channel taps. We obtain two different
but equivalent models for the received pilot signals under
frequency-selective Rayleigh fading. Based on each model,
we formulate device activity detection as a non-convex MLE
problem and propose an iterative algorithm to obtain a station-
ary point using optimal techniques. The two proposed MLE-
based device activity detection methods have the identical

computational complexity order O(N P L2) and degrade to the
existing MLE-based device activity detection method [5], [6]
when P = 1. Notice that conventional channel estimation
methods can be readily applied for channel estimation of
detected active devices under frequency-selective Rayleigh
fading, based on one of the derived models for the received
pilot signals. Numerical results show that the two proposed
methods offer promising device activity detection design for

frequency-selective Rayleigh fading. Furthermore, one method
always achieves a lower error rate than the other with a shorter
computation time if P is small and a longer computation time
otherwise. This is the first work investigating massive grant-
free access under frequency-selective fading to the best of our
knowledge.

by calligraphic letters (e.g., X ). The notation xi represents
the i-th element of vector x, Xi,: represents the i-th row of

II. SYSTEM MODEL

We consider a single-cell cellular network with one M -
antenna BS and N single-antenna IoT devices. Let M ,
{1, 2,··· , M} and N , {1, 2,··· , N} denote the sets of
device and antenna indices, respectively. For all n ∈ N , let
gn > 0 denote the large-scale fading power of the channel
between device n and the BS. Small-scale fading follows the
block fading model, i.e., small-scale fading coefficients remain
constant within each coherence block and are independent
and identically distributed (i.i.d.) over coherence blocks. We
consider a wideband system and adopt the frequency-selective
Rayleigh fading channel model for small-scale fading. Let P
denote the number of channel taps, and let P , {1, 2,··· , P}
denote the set of channel tap indices. Denote hn,m,p ∈ C as the
p-th coefficient of the channel impulse response (CIR) of the
channel between device n and the BS over antenna m, for all
n ∈ N , m ∈ M, p ∈ P. We assume hn,m,p ∼ CN (0, 1), n ∈
N , m ∈ M, p ∈ P.
We study the massive access scenario arising from mMTC,
where very few devices among a large number of potential
devices are active and access the BS in each coherence block.
For all n ∈ N , let αn ∈ {0, 1} denote the activity state of
device n, where αn = 1 indicates that device n is active and
αn = 0 otherwise. In the considered massive access scenario,
Pn∈N
αn ≪ N , i.e., α , (αn)n∈N ∈ {0, 1}N is sparse.
Let L denote the number of subcarriers, and denote L ,
{1, 2,··· , L} as the set of subcarrier indices. Assume P < L.
Each device n ∈ N is pre-assigned a specific pilot sequence
sn , (sn,ℓ)ℓ∈L ∈ CL consisting of L ≪ N OFDM symbols,
each carried by one subcarrier. In the pilot transmission phase,
active devices simultaneously send their length-L pilots to the
BS over the L subcarriers, and the BS detects the activity states
of all devices and estimates the channel states of all active

devices from the LM received OFDM symbols over the M
antennas. In this paper, we focus on device activity detection
under frequency-selective Rayleigh fading, which is more
challenging than device activity detection under flat Rayleigh
fading [1], [2], [4] -- [7]. We shall see that based on one of
the derived models for the received pilot signals, conventional
channel estimation methods can be readily applied for channel
estimation of detected active devices.

The time domain representation of the OFDM symbols

in sn ∈ CL, i.e., the normalized inverse discrete Fourier
transform (IDFT) of sn, is given by:

sn = FHsn ∈ CL, n ∈ N .

Here, F , (Fℓ,ℓ′ )ℓ,ℓ′∈L ∈ CL×L denotes the discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) matrix where Fℓ,ℓ′ , 1√L

each device n ∈ N , a cyclic prefix is appended to sn before
transmission. After removing the signal corresponding to the
cyclic prefixes, the received signal over the L signal dimen-
sions at antenna m ∈ M, denoted as rm , (rℓ,m)ℓ∈L ∈ CL,

For ease of exposition, we assume that the large-scale fading
powers, gn, n ∈ N , are known to the BS and propose two
MLE-based device activity detection methods in Section III
and Section IV, respectively. The proposed methods can be
readily extended to device activity detection with unknown
large-scale fading powers [5]. Later in Section V, we shall
see that compared to the method in Section IV, the method in
Section III achieves high detection accuracy for all P , short
computation time for small P , and long computation time for
large P . Therefore, we can apply them according to practical
system parameters and requirements.

III. MLE-BASED DEVICE ACTIVITY DETECTION USING

COORDINATE DESCENT METHOD

In this section, we propose an MLE-based device activity
detection method based on the expression of rm in (5) and
the coordinate descent method.

f (1)(α) depends on R only through bΣR. Thus, the MLE

problem of α can be formulated as:1

Problem 1 (MLE for Activity Detection of Actual Devices):

(8)

Problem 1 is a non-convex optimization problem. When
P = 1, Problem 1 is equivalent to the MLE problem for
activity detection of N devices under flat Rayleigh fading in
[5] and can be converted to the same form as the one in [5].
When P ∈ {2, 3, ...}, Problem 1 is different from the one in
n ∈ CL×L
[5] and cannot be converted to its form (as SnSH
is not a rank-one matrix). Later, we shall see that this slight
difference causes a significant challenge for solving Problem 1.

B. Solution

The goal of solving a non-convex problem is usually
to obtain a stationary point of the problem. We adopt the
coordinate descent method to obtain a stationary point of
Problem 1. Specifically, given α obtained in the previous step,
the coordinate descent optimization w.r.t. αn is equivalent to
the optimization of the increment d in αn [5]:
f (1)(α + den).

We shall see that it is more challenging to solve the coordinate
descent optimization for P ∈ {2, 3, ...} in (10) than to solve
that for P = 1. In the following, we define two important
functions based on which we can characterize the optimal
solution of the problem in (10). Specifically, we first define

numerically otherwise [9]. Besides, note that the computa-
tional complexities for obtaining the roots of a polynomial
with degree q analytically and numerically are O(q) and
O(q3), respectively [9]. Thus, D(1)
n can be obtained in closed-
form with computational complexity O(P ) if P ∈ {1, 2} and
numerically with computational complexity O(P 3) otherwise.
The details of the coordinate descent algorithm are summa-
rized in Algorithm 1. If each coordinate optimization in (10)
has a unique optimal solution, Algorithm 1 converges to a
stationary point of Problem 1, as the number of the iteration
goes to infinity [10, Proposition 2.7.1]. The complexities of

Step 4, Step 6, and Step 7 are O(P L2), O(1), and O(P L2),
respectively (note that P < L). Thus,
complexity of each iteration of Algorithm 1 is O(N P L2).

IV. MLE-BASED DEVICE ACTIVITY DETECTION USING
PENALTY METHOD AND COORDINATE DESCENT METHOD

In this section, we propose an MLE-based device activity
detection method based on an equivalent form of the received
signal rm in (5). Notice that based on this equivalent form,
conventional channel estimation methods can be directly ap-
plied for channel estimation of detected active devices under
frequency-selective Rayleigh fading.

A. Problem Formulation

First, we formulate an MLE problem for activity detection

of N P virtual devices. Let I , {1, ..., N P} denote the set
of virtual devices. Let βi denote the activity states of virtual

(21)

Problem 2 is also a non-convex optimization problem. It
differentiates from Problem 1, as Σ(1)

forms. Besides, the objective function of Problem 2 shares
the same form as the objective function of the MLE problem
for activity detection of N P devices under flat Rayleigh

fading in [5] except that the dimensions of S ∈ CL×N P ,
B ∈ CN P×N P , G ∈ CN P×N P , and hm ∈ CN P . However,

unlike Problem 1 and the ML estimation problem in [5],
Problem 2 has extra coupling constraints in (14). To address
the issue caused by the coupling constraints in (14), we apply
the penalty method [10] to obtain a stationary point of an
equivalent problem of Problem 2 in Section IV-B. Later in
Section V, we shall see that the device activity detection
method based on the penalty method has a higher accuracy
and a higher computational complexity than the method based
on relaxation. After solving Problem 2 for β, we can construct
a device activities of the N actual devices α according to (16)

Algorithm 2 Coordinate Descent Algorithm for Problem 3

We disregard the coupling constraints in (14) and add to the
objective function of Problem 2 a penalty for violating them.
Then, we can convert Problem 2 to the following problem.

Problem 3 (Penalty Problem of Problem 2):

is the penalty function.

If ρ is sufficiently large, an optimal solution of Problem 3
is also optimal for Problem 2 (as f (2)(β) is bounded from
above) [10]. Now, we adopt the coordinate descent method to
obtain a stationary point of Problem 3 instead of Problem 2.
Specifically, given β obtained in the previous step, the coor-
dinate descent optimization with respect to βi is equivalent to
the optimization of the increment d in βi:

min

d∈[−βi,1−βi]

f (2)(β + dei).

(23)

We shall see that it is more challenging to solve the coordinate
optimization in (24) than to solve the MLE problem for flat
Rayleigh fading in [5]. Similarly, we define two important
functions before solving the problem (23), i.e., f (2)
β,i (d) in (23),

As g(2)

The details of the coordinate descent algorithm are sum-
marized in Algorithm 2. If each coordinate optimization in
(23) has a unique optimal solution, Algorithm 2 converges to
a stationary point of Problem 3 as the number of iteration
goes to infinity [10, Proposition 2.7.1]. The computational

i

complexities of Step 4, Step 6, and Step 7 are O(L2), O(1),
and O(L2), respectively. Thus, the computational complexity
of each iteration of Algorithm 2 is O(cid:0)N P L2(cid:1).

Prop.-MLE-Alg. 2, respectively. We consider three baseline
schemes, namely, BL-MLE, BL-GL, and BL-AMP, which are
obtained by applying the existing MLE [6], GROUP LASSO
[4], and AMP [2], proposed for flat Rayleigh fading, to detect
the activities of the N P virtual devices, β, without considering
the constraints in (14), and then setting the activities of the

, n ∈
N actual devices, α, according to αn =
N . The thresholds for the MLE-based schemes and BL-
GL are numerically optimized. The threshold for BL-AMP
is chosen as in [2]. We generate pilots according to i.i.d.
CN (0, IL) and normalize their norms to √L [5], [6]. In the
simulation, we independently generate 1000 realizations for
αn ∼ B(1000, 0.07), n ∈ N , hn,m,p ∼ CN (0, 1), n ∈ N ,
m ∈ M, p ∈ P, and Gaussian pilots in each realization
and evaluate the average error rate over all 1000 realizations.
Unless otherwise stated, we choose N = 1000, L = 72,
M = 128, P = 4, gn = 1, n ∈ N , and σ2 = 0.1.
Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b) plot the error rate versus the number
of channel taps P and the pilot length L, respectively. From
the two figures, we can make the following observations. The
MLE-based schemes significantly outperform the compressed
sensing-based schemes, BL-AMP and BL-GL. Note that at
small L, BL-AMP does not work properly, yielding a poor
error rate. The two proposed MLE-based schemes outperform
BL-MLE, as they rigorously tackle the MLE problems. Prop.-
MLE-Alg. 1 for solving Problem 1 with size N achieves a
smaller error rate than Prop.-MLE-Alg. 2 for solving Problem 3
with size N P , as a problem with a smaller size can be more
effectively solved. Besides, the error rates of most schemes
increase with P and decrease with L. The slight increase of the
error rate of Prop.-MLE-Alg. 1 with P when P ≥ 3 is mainly
due to the numerical error for determining D(1)
n , n ∈ N . The
increase of the error rates of the other schemes with P derives
from the increase in the number of virtual devices.

Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b) plot the ratio between the compu-
tation time of Prop.-MLE-Alg. 1 and the computation time of
Prop.-MLE-Alg. 2 versus the number of channel taps P at
different pilot lengths. Prop.-MLE-Alg. 1 has shorter compu-
tation time than Prop.-MLE-Alg. 2 at small P , as the overall
n , n ∈ N analytically
is short at small P . Prop.-MLE-Alg. 1 has larger computation
time than Prop.-MLE-Alg. 2 at large P , as the overall compu-

computation time for determining D(1)

tation time for determining D(2)

, i ∈ I analytically is shorter
at large P . When L is large, Prop.-MLE-Alg. 1 outperforms
Prop.-MLE-Alg. 2 at most practical values of P .

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we first presented an OFDM-based massive
grant-free access scheme for a wideband system. Then, we
proposed two MLE-based device activity detection methods
for frequency-selective Rayleigh fading using statistical esti-
mation and optimization techniques. The two proposed meth-
ods have different preferable system parameters and include
the existing MLE-based method for flat Rayleigh fading as
a special case. Conventional channel estimation methods can
be directly applied for channel estimation of detected active
devices under frequency selective Rayleigh fading, based on
a received pilot signal model derived in this paper.
