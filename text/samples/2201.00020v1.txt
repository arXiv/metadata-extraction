We develop the microscopic theory for the emergence of multiple graviton modes (GMs) in frac-
tional quantum Hall (FQH) fluids, and show explicitly these modes are associated with the geometric
fluctuation of well-defined conformal Hilbert spaces (CHS). These Hilbert spaces are hierarchical
subspaces within a single Landau level, each with emergent conformal symmetry and continuously
parameterized by a unimodular metric. We show explicitly the multiple GMs originate from the
spectral weights of the long wavelength GMP modes in each of the CHSs, corresponding to the quan-
tum fluctuation of each of its metric. For different FQH phases, whether or not the spectral weight
in a certain CHS is zero can be analytically derived. This leads to a number of statements about the
number of GMs as well as merging and splitting of those modes, which we verified numerically. We
also discuss how the microscopic theory can serve as the basis for the additional Haldane modes in
the effective field theory description, and their experimental relevance to realistic electron-electron
interaction.

Gravitons are hypothetical spin-2 bosons from the
quantization of gravitational field, the existence of which
has not been confirmed by experiments and remained one
of the most interesting unsolved mysteries in physics[1,
2]. There also exist the analogous "graviton modes"
in the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) droplet, which
is a two-dimensional quantum fluid of electrons subject
to a strong magnetic field at low temperature. As a
typical manifestation of the interplay between topology
and geometry, the graviton modes are collective neu-
tral excitations with spin-2, originating from the metric
fluctuations emerging from the strong interactions be-
tween electrons[3 -- 5]. While Lorentz invariance is ab-
sent in this (2 + 1)-dimensional space-time, these 2D
graviton modes encode topological
information about
their respective FQH phases, and their dynamics lead
to rich physics ranging from ground state incompressibil-
ity to the dynamical phase transitions of the low-lying
excitations[6, 7].

The effective field theory studying these modes has
been proposed by using the Newton-Carton metric, and
various experimental proposals for the observation of
these modes have been put forward[8?  -- 16]. The stan-
dard technique in probing neutral excitations is to use
inelastic photon scattering[17 -- 21]. The coupling between
the graviton modes and the acoustic waves can also be
used to simulate the behaviour of gravitons interacting
with the gravitational waves[22]. Meanwhile, the micro-
scopic theory of the graviton modes with model Hamilto-
nians has also been established to provide insights for the
experiments, where model Hamiltonians for the gravi-
ton modes have been constructed for FQH fluids at dif-
ferent filling factors[7, 23]. Recently numerical results
have implied the signature of multiple graviton modes

in FQH states, the microscopic understanding of which
is under development[24, 25]. Given that most of the
research so far on graviton modes are based on effec-
tive field-theoretical descriptions and numerical analysis,
a detailed microscopic theory is needed for a more com-
plete characterisation of the emergence and interaction
between different graviton modes.

In this article, we show analytically that multiple gravi-
ton modes (GM) is a generic feature for FQH fluids,
from the splitting of the long wavelength limit of the
GMP mode[3] in different subspaces in a single LL. Us-
ing the analytic tools we developed earlier[7], we demon-
strate that the number of GMs is dynamical in nature,
and is only meaningful when referring to specific in-
teraction Hamiltonians. Each GM can be interpreted
as the metric fluctuation of a conformal Hilbert space
(or the null spaces of model Hamiltonians, as explained
later) within a single LL. For short-range two-body in-
teractions, we show all non-Laughlin FQH states around
ν = 1/(2n) with n > 1 (e.g. within the null space of
V 2bdy
V 2bdy
2k−1 Haldane pseudopotential interac-
tion) have at least two GMs.
In particular, the Jain
states at ν = N/ (2nN ± 1) and the Pfaffian states at
ν = 1/(2n) all have two GMs if n, N > 1. The Laughlin
states (N = 1) and the Jain states with n = 1 all have
a single GM. This agrees with the special cases studied
in both[24, 25] at ν = 2/7, 2/9, 1/4, at the same time
providing an analytic explanation and geometric inter-
pretation to their numerical observations. Examples of
FQH states with three GMs with short-range interactions
are given, and the formalism also makes it transparent on
how multiple GMs obey the spectral sum rule and satisfy
the Haldane bound. We illustrate some interesting cases
with numerical calculations and discuss their experimen-
tal significance. The microscopic theory also serves as
the basis for the effective field theory, where we show the
necessity of additional Haldane modes depends on the
proper identification of the base space of such theories.

FIG. 1. Intrinsic metrics in FQH states. The left panel
shows that the fluctuations of the cyclotron metric gab origi-
nate from the LL mixing. The right panel shows the hierarchi-
cal structure of the CHSs (null spaces) of the corresponding
model Hamiltonians (more details can be found in Table.II)
in the lowest Landau level. Each of these spaces can have its
own metric gab
, the fluctuation around which can potentially

lead to multiple graviton modes in a single Landau level.

The cyclotron and guiding center metric --  It is useful
to first consider the simple case of the integer quantum
Hall effect (IQHE), which are topological phases coming
from fully filled Landau levels (LL). We are dealing with
the following full Hamiltonian:

H =

1
2m

gab πia πib + Vint

(1)

Ne(cid:88)

i=1

For simplicity we assumed Galilean invariance for the
first kinetic energy term. Here πia = pia + e Aia denotes
the dynamical momentum operator of the i-th electron
(pi is the canonical momentum and Ai is the external
vector potential), with the commutation rules [πia, πjb] =
B. Here the magnetic field is B = ab∂a Aib and
iδijab/(cid:96)2

the magnetic length is (cid:96)B = (cid:112)1/eB. We assume the

cyclotron energy is the dominant energy scale, so any
LL mixing induced by electron-electron interaction can
be perturbatively captured by few-body interaction of
the second term Vint, which now describes the dynam-
ics only within a single LL[26 -- 30]. The important note
here is that the Hilbert space of a single LL, which we
will refer to as the lowest LL (LLL) without loss of gen-
erality, is parametrized by the unimodular metric gab
in Eq.(1), which is physically the effective mass tensor.
Quantum fluctuations around this metric thus lead to
density modes in higher LLs, which we can term as "cy-
clotron gravitons". The energy of this GM is very high
with large magnetic field. It is the only GM for the IQHE,
since the LLL is fully filled.

For FQHE in a partially filled LL, the dynamics is
determined entirely by the guiding center coordinates
¯Ra = ra − ab πb(cid:96)2

Bab,(cid:2) ¯Ra, ¯Rb(cid:3) = −i(cid:96)2

(cid:104) Ra, Rb(cid:105)

= i(cid:96)2

(cid:90)

where we define Ra = (cid:96)2
Bab πb. This implies the interac-
tion energy Vint is a functional of ¯Ri only and commutes
with the kinetic energy. It can be explicitly expressed as:

Vint =

d2qVq ¯ρq ¯ρ−q

where ¯ρq = (cid:80)
mentum space q = (cid:112)¯gabqaqb, which is physically in-

i eiq· ¯Ri is the guiding center density op-
erator. For rotationally invariant systems we have a
new unimodular metric ¯gab defining distance in the mo-

(3)

dependent from gab. We illustrate a complete analogy
to the "cyclotron graviton" in the IQHE by using the
simple example of Vint = V 2bdy
, or the model Hamilto-
nian for the Laughlin ν = 1/3 state. Just like the LLL,
which is the null space of the kinetic energy parame-
terized by gab, the null space of V 2bdy
(spanned by the
Laughlin ground state and quasiholes) is parametrized
by ¯gab. The quantum fluctuation around gab gives the
"cyclotron graviton" outside of LLL, while that of ¯gab
gives the well-known graviton or quadrupole mode (the
long wavelength limit of the GMP mode) outside of the
V 2bdy
1

null space[5].

We would like to emphasize the arguments above ap-
plies to any Vint with an incompressible ground state.
Thus generally speaking all FQH states have at least two
GMs due to the structure of the full Hamiltonian: the
cyclotron GM residing in higher LLs which is at very
high energy due to the large magnetic field, and at least
one guiding center GM within the LLL. For the rest of
this work we will ignore the cyclotron GM and focus on
the dynamics within the LLL, though we will borrow the
same concept when understanding the emergence of mul-
tiple guiding center GMs from Vint.

formal Hilbert spaces (CHSs), because they are believed
to be generated by the conformal operators (i.e.
the
Virasoro algebra)[31, 32].
In many cases such Hilbert
spaces are spanned by degenerate (zero energy) many-
body states of special local Hamiltonians, including the
well-known generalised pseudopotentials, that physically
project into the angular momentum sectors of a cluster of
electrons[33, 34]. The null spaces of these Hamiltonians
have conformal symmetry in the thermodynamic limit,
and those zero energy states are the ground states and
quasiholes of a particular FQH phase (though some are
believed to be gapless phases)[35, 36]. More importantly
like the Hilbert space of the LLL (or any other single
LL), such CHSs are built up with quasiparticles, which
are emergent particles from LL projection and strong in-
teraction. In the LLL, the quasiparticles are simply elec-
trons projected into a single LL, while in other CHSs,
they can be abelian or non-abelian anyons[37 -- 43].
Let Hα be one of these CHSs, and the null space of
the corresponding model Hamiltonian Vα. Just like in
α , and Hα
Eq.(3), Vα contains a guiding center metric gab
continuously depends on it. This is the geometric as-
pect we would like to introduce to the CHSs, and each
of them can be completely characterised by a triplet of
α }. For the special case where Hα = HLLL,
{Hα, Vα, gab
the entire Hilbert space of the LLL, Vα is the kinetic en-
ergy Hamiltonian and gab
α = gab is the cyclotron metric or
the effective mass tensor. All other CHSs are subspaces
of HLLL.
In Fig.
(1) we illustrate a hierarchical structure of
different Hα in the LLL[7]. For a given Hα, it is possible
to find another Hβ ⊂ Hα.
α , we can still
define a Hβ freely parametrized by gab
β that is completely
within Hα. This is straightforward for Hα = HLLL, since
the cyclotron coordinates and guiding center coordinates
commute. For other pairs of CHSs, such geometric tuning
can only be realised with the following Hamiltonian:

If we fix gab

Vint = λα Vα + λβ Vβ

(4)
with λα (cid:29) λβ > 0 (the metric dependence of Vα,β is
implicit). For any ground state ψ(cid:105) ⊂ Hβ of Eq.(4) we

can thus define two types of area-preserving deformation:

Hα so that Vαψχ

geometric deformation of Hβ. Eq.(6) is entirely outside of
Hα and in some cases it will vanish, as we will see later.
If it is non-vanishing, then ψχ
2 (cid:105) is associated with the
geometric deformation of Hα. This geometric descrip-
tion forms the basis of possible multiple GMs in different
FQH phases, dictated by "model Hamiltonians" in the
form of Eq.(4), and can be resolved by realistic Hamilto-
nians close to those model Hamiltonians.

let us start with a collection of CHSs {Hk, Vk, gab

the LLL, and also with a hierarchical structure Hk+1 ⊂

All metrics gab
k in the Hamiltonian is arbitrary and with-
k = I2, since
out loss of generality we can set them as gab
the GMs are quantum fluctuations around these fixed
metrics. Let the ground state of Eq.(7) be ψ0(cid:105) ∈ Hm,
so the quadrupole excitation is obtained from the long
wavelength limit of the GMP mode or single mode ap-
proximation defined as follows[3, 4]:

ψg(cid:105) = lim

(8)

Note that ψg(cid:105) and ψ0(cid:105) are orthogonal, and Sq is the reg-
ularised guiding center structure factor with limq→0 Sq ∼
ηq4. The Haldane bound dictates that the value of η
gives the upper bound to the topological shift of ψ0(cid:105)[44].
The important question to ask here, is in which CHS
does ψg(cid:105) reside in. If ψg(cid:105) ∈ Hk and ψg(cid:105) /∈ Hk+1, then
obviously there is no GM associated with the quantum
fluctuation around gab
k , since such fluctuation will bring
us out of Hk. However, ψg(cid:105) can be decomposed to mul-
tiple modes, each within Hk(cid:48)>k but outside of the Hk(cid:48)+1,
associated with the quantum fluctuation around gab
k(cid:48)+1,
as long as ψ0(cid:105) ∈ Hk(cid:48)+1. This is most easily seen from
computing the spectral function defined below:

Eq.(7). Given that λk (cid:29) λk+1, we will see m − k dis-
tinct peaks well separated in energy, corresponding to
m − k GMs each with transparent geometric interpreta-
tion as illustrated in Fig.2(a). The spectral sum rule for
the guiding center structure factor will clearly be satis-
fied from all the contributions of these GMs, as long as
ψg(cid:105) lives completely within Hk.

Short-range two-body interaction --  A number of ana-
lytical results have been derived in our previous works,
which are rigorous in the thermodynamic limit and very
useful in determining which CHS ψg(cid:105) resides in[7]. Let
us first take Vint in Eq.(7) as a sum of short-range two-
body interactions as follows:

(we take H2bdy

2i−1 as the (2i−1)th Haldane PP, where fermionic
with V 2bdy
statistics has been considered. Thus the corresponding
null spaces H2bdy
is spanned by the Laughlin ground
state and quasiholes at ν = 1/ (2n + 1). Here we can
prove analytically[7] that ψg(cid:105) of the Laughlin phase at
ν = 1/(2n + 1) resides within H2bdy
n−1 but completely
= HLLL), which is
outside of H2bdy
saturated by the ground state and quasiholes. Thus
there can only be one GM and one peak in the spec-
tral function, associated with the metric fluctuation of
gab
n . There are, however, many other FQH states that
are incompressible with Eq.(7) but not in H2bdy
. These
include the Jain states at ν = N/(2nN + 1), N > 1 and
their particle-hole (PH) conjugate states (within H2bdy
n−1 )
at ν = N/(2nN − 1), N > 1. Note that all these
states still resides within H2bdy
n−1 , though the ground state
and quasiholes do not saturate H2bdy
n−1 . One can prove

n

n

analytically that their corresponding ψg(cid:105) all satisfies
ψg(cid:105) ∈ H2bdy
n−2 . While they are again completely outside
, now they have spectral weights within H2bdy
of H2bdy
n−1 .
Thus each of those states will have two GMs with re-
spect to Eq.(7), a generic result agreeing some special
cases studied before[24, 25]. These two GMs are asso-
ciated with the fluctuation of the metric gab
n−1, and
they can also be understood via clustering properties in
parton constructions[25].

n , gab

Non-abelian FQH states are particularly interesting in
strongly correlated topological systems, and their GMs
can also be predicted in a similar fashion, assuming that
they can be stabilised by realistic interactions adiabati-
cally connected to Eq.(7). For example the Pfaffian state
at ν = 1/(2n) can be understood as a condensate of
paired composite fermions, each with one electron at-
tached to 2n magnetic fluxes[45, 46]. The model states
of these FQH phases all live within H2bdy
n−1 . For short-
range two-body interactions they will also all have two
GMs, one within H2bdy

n−1 , and the other within H2bdy
n−2 .

It is also interesting to note with short-range two-body
interaction, all FQH states related to the Laughlin states
by particle-hole (PH) conjugation will have at most two
GMs. There can be multiple well-defined PH conjuga-
tions for each Laughlin state in different Laughlin CHSs,
not just within LLL (where PH conjugation relates the
state at ν to 1 − ν). This is because for the Laughlin
state at ν = 1/(2n + 1), it can also be reinterpreted as
a Laughlin state of composite fermions (CF) with each
electron attached to 2k magnetic fluxes (k < n), at the
CF fractional filling factor ν∗ = 1/(2(n − k) + 1)[47, 48]
as Fig.2(b) shows. We can thus rigorously define the PH
conjugate of CFs within H2bdy
, at the CF filling factor
of ν∗ = 2(n − k)/(2(n − k) + 1), corresponding to the
electron filling factor ν = 2(n− k)/(2(n− k)(2k + 1) + 1).

ν = 1/7 within H2bdy
, at ν = 4/13) will be discussed in
details later.

Few-body non-Abelian interactions --  We now illustrate
that the number of GMs is a dynamical property strongly
dependent on the interaction. Let us first look at the
Jain state at ν = 2/9, corresponding to the ν∗ = 2 state
of the CFs with each electron bound to four magnetic
fluxes, or the ν∗ = 2/5 state of the CFs with each electron
bound to two magnetic fluxes. We have argued before
that with short-range two-body interactions, this FQH
state has two GMs.
It is important to note, however,
while the CHS of this FQH state is well-defined from
the CF construction, such construction does not allow an
exact model Hamiltonian within the LLL. The two-body
interaction only defines its CHS approximately, though
to a very good level of accuracy. A better microscopic
Hamiltonian is given as follows:

doubly degenerate, so here we take them as an arbitrary
linear combination (the CHS is invariant). The unique
highest density ground state of Eq.(11) with n = 11 has
very high overlap with the Jain ν = 2/9 state (∼ 0.99
for eight electrons). While its quasihole counting is non-
Abelian, one could conjecture that the ground state is
topologically equivalent to the Jain state, in analogy to
the Gaffnian state and the Jain ν = 2/5 state that has
been studied before[32, 49].

n

Such subtleties, while important by themselves, do
not really affect our discussions about GMs, which are
gapped excitations. The main message here is that
the null spaces of V 3bdy
give a family of CHSs beyond
the Laughlin CHSs discussed before. The Moore-Read,
Gaffnian and Haffnian CHSs are illustrated in Fig.1, cor-
responding to the case of n = 3, 5, 6 respectively. Let the

ν = 2/9 resides in H3bdy

. We can thus construct
the following Hamiltonian:

(one from the metric fluctuation of H3bdy

the ν = 2/9 phase, and the other from the metric fluctu-
ation of H2bdy
), there will be a third GM from the metric
fluctuation of H3bdy
, easily observable from the spectral
function. If we tune λ2 to zero, then the two GMs of the
lower energies will gradually merge, to become a single
GM within H2bdy
, accounting only for the metric fluctu-
ation of the CHS of the ν = 2/9 as shown in Fig.4. The

For the FQH states with ν = 2/7 and 4/13, model Hamil-
tonians show similar signatures of two peaks in the spectral

Each Laughlin state at ν = 1/(2n + 1) thus have n PH
conjugate state with k = 0, 2,··· n − 1, with k = 0 the
usual PH conjugate state in LLL at ν = 2n/(2n + 1).
Since the ν = 2(n − k)/(2(n − k)(2k + 1) + 1) state
lives entirely within H2bdy
and entirely outside of H2bdy
k+1 ,
one can rigorously show[7] its graviton mode lives en-
tirely within H2bdy
leading to two GMs.

These two GMs come from the fluctuation of gab
k , as

of ν = 2(n − k)/(2(n − k)(2k + 1) + 1). For k = 0,
the anti-Laughlin state at ν = 2n/(2n + 1) only has one

merging and splitting of GMs can also be expected for
the non-Abelian Pfaffian state at ν = 1/4, which simi-
larly has an exact three-body model Hamiltonian[50 -- 52].
We will discuss in more details next with numerical com-
putations.

Numerical results and GM interactions --  While the
main concepts and predictions of the GMs have been
formulated analytically above, it is also useful to fur-
ther illustrate the formalism with examples of numerical
calculations. The spectral functions for the Jain states
at ν = 2/7, 2/9, 1/4 with Coulomb interaction has been
computed[24, 25]. Here we compute the spectral func-
tions of these and additional FQH states with model
Hamiltonians, to show that two or even more peaks can
be unambiguously resolved and far separated as com-
pared to the realistic interactions.

The first two examples are the Jain state at ν = 2/7
(the PH conjugate of the Laughlin ν = 1/5 state within
H2bdy
) and the Jain state at ν = 4/13 (the PH conju-
gate of the Laughlin ν = 1/7 state within H2bdy
, with
some experimental evidence[53]). In both cases the PH
conjugate is defined for CFs, each with one electron at-
tached to two fluxes. The CHS of both phases are proper
subspaces of H2bdy
. Thus there
will be a non-zero component of the graviton outside of
H2bdy
. A short-range two-body interaction with a very
dominant V 2bdy
can thus easily resolve the two GMs as
previously predicted (see Fig.(3a,b)). The two GMs can
also be clearly resolved with VLLL since it is dominated
by V 2bdy

, but outside of H2bdy

The Jain state at ν = 2/11 offers an interesting con-
trast, which is the PH conjugate of the Laughlin ν = 1/7
state within the H2bdy
, defined for CFs with one electron
attached to four fluxes. The two GMs are within and out-
side of H2bdy
, so it can be clearly resolved with a model
Hamiltonian with a dominant V 2bdy
(and a dominant

V 2bdy
to maintain the ground state gap). However with
1
VLLL the strength of V 2bdy
is only slightly larger than
that of V 2bdy
, and it cannot clearly resolve the two GMs
(see Fig.(3c)). This is an example when reducing the
V 2bdy
of the interaction leads to the mixing and merging
3
of the two GMs into a single GM, while the ground state
is not affected at all, since it is in the null space of V 2bdy
.
Note that the energies of the GMs for this FQH phase
are not affected by the V 2bdy
component of the two-body
interaction.

For the Jain state at ν = 2/9, any V 2bdy

VLLL) will give two GMs, as can be
interaction (e.g.
analytically proven. From numerical studies with eight
electrons, the spectral weight of the GM outside H2bdy
is
small as compared to other Jain states. It is also another
example where a single GM (here within H2bdy
) can be
split into two GMs, this time with the introduction of the
three-body interactions. We can analytically show that
within H2bdy
, there is non-zero graviton spectral weight
both within and outside of H3bdy
. Thus an introduc-
tion of V 3bdy
to the microscopic Hamiltonian can lead to
the splitting of the two GMs in total to three GMs, as
shown in Fig.4. It is worth noting that the GM within
H3bdy
dominates, and both the second and the third GM
have the spectral weights that are more than one order
of magnitude smaller. This could be a finite size effect,
since we can analytically show that the spectral weights
of all three GMs are non-zero for any finite systems. It is
still possible, however, that in the thermodynamic limit
the weights of the second and/or third GM vanish. We
are unable to numerically access system sizes with more
than eight electrons, and will leave more detailed discus-
sions to future works.

ν = 1/2 (believed to be stabilised by second LL Coulomb
interaction)[31, 54], this state can also be stabilised by a
slightly modified VLLL, with an overlap of 0.91 for eight
electrons. While this small perturbation may not be
easily realised in experiments, with this Hamiltonian we
have the clear understanding that there will be two GMs
(one inside, and the other outside of H2bdy
). It is inter-
esting to note that we have the hierarchical relationship
that H3bdy
, and both GMs are within
H3bdy
. Thus
with the model Hamiltonian consisting of only three-
body PPs, the two GMs will again merge to become
a single GM, in the absence of V 2bdy
, as reflected in
Fig.5. For non-Abelian states there are additional neu-
tral modes, e.g. the "gravitino" modes at spin s = 3/2 for
Pfaffian[4, 55], that can be considered as super-partners
of the gravitons. We expect multiple GMs will also lead
to multiple gravitino modes, and will leave detailed dis-
cussions elsewhere.

The experimental relevance --  The experimental detec-
tion of the multiple GMs in FQH systems and the inter-
action among them is particularly interesting, because of
both the topological and geometric aspects of such neu-
tral excitations. Seeing clean signals of different GMs
in experiments could be difficult. This is both because
the GMs are buried in the energy continuum and thus
are easily scattered by disorders, and also because with
realistic interactions different GMs can interact and mix
strongly. The microscopic picture we developed points to
the crucial role of the hierarchy of energy scales associ-
ated with different CHSs, that realistic interaction needs
to imitate to resolve multiple GMs. Thus the realisation
of robust Hall plateau may not be enough for the detec-
tion of GMs. The experimental system may need to be
flexible enough in tuning the effective electron-electron

interactions, so as to control the dynamics of low-lying
gapped excitations.

For systems when the LL mixing is negligible (e.g. with
strong magnetic field), our calculation shows that short-
range interaction (e.g. the Coulomb interaction in the
LLL) can at most resolve two GMs both for abelian and
non-Abelian FQH phases, and we have not found any ex-
ceptions. The universality of such results is due to the
algebraic structure of the Laughlin CHSs, and to clearly
resolve the two GMs, we prefer to have the effective in-
teraction to be as short-range as possible. Formally if we
expand the realistic two-body interaction in the Haldane
PP basis, we should aim to have the ratio consecutive
PP coefficients (i.e. the ratio of the coefficient of V 2bdy
over that of V 2bdy
i+1 ) to be large. This can be achieved by
screening of electron-electron interaction, or by increas-
ing the sample thickness in experiments. In particular,
Jain states at ν = N/(2nN + 1) with N > 1, as well as
PH conjugate states at ν = 2(n−k)/(2(n−k)(2k +1)+1)
with k > 0, will all have two GMs. Numerical calcula-
tions also show such short range interactions favour the
incompressibility of these FQH states, as compared to
the bare Coulomb interaction.

i

The most easily observed second GM in experiments
would be the one outside of the V1 null space (i.e. H1),
which requires a dominant V1 interaction and can be
realised with the Coulomb interaction within the LLL
for FQH states around ν = 1/4 as discussed in previous
works[7]. For FQH states in the SLL, however, the GM
outside of H1 will mix strongly with the ones inside H1,
because of the significantly stronger V3 as compared to
LLL Coulomb interaction. It is also important to note
while the FQH states around ν = 1/6 (e.g. the ν = 2/11
state) all in principle have at least two GMs (except for
the Laughlin state at ν = 1/7), they will be hard to

cause such GMs have to be resolved by a dominant V 2bdy
(as compared to V 2bdy
k>3 ), which is not the case for LLL
Coulomb interaction. Thus in general, the observation of
multiple GMs even for simple two-body interactions will
necessarily require careful tuning of experimental param-
eters with Coulomb based interaction.

3

The short-range two-body interactions do not favour
non-Abelian FQH states, as the compressible composite
Fermi liquid (CFL) states are generally more competi-
tive, for example at ν = 1/(2n)[26, 56 -- 59]. For non-
Abelian FQH states we generally require longer-range
interactions (e.g. Coulomb interaction in the second
LL), or few-body interactions from LL mixing[26, 32, 52].
While it is hard to predict from finite size numerical cal-
culations how these exotic states can be stabilised by
the realistic interactions, these additional ingredients are
necessary if we would like to observe more than two GMs.
A possible candidate for three GMs seems to be the Jain
state at ν = 2/9, where we have shown that the proper
introduction of three-body interactions can lead to three
peaks in the spectral function. We expect one of the
peaks resolved by the three-body interaction to be rather
weak, and the dominant peak resides at low energies. For
this state our numerical results so far are also inconclu-
sive due to the small system sizes accessible, and more
work is needed to establish its behaviour from finite size
scaling.

Microscopic basis for the effective field theory --  For the
effective field theory construction, the number of grav-
itational fields needed (i.e.
the Haldane modes) for a
complete description of the response to the metric fluc-
tuation should be determined by the underlying micro-
scopic theory. It is important to first identify the physical
Hilbert space on which the effective field theory is based.
For example, for the Jain states near ν = 1/(2n), the
elementary particles are CFs with each electron bound
to 2n magnetic fluxes (and their PH conjugates, or CF
holes). The Hilbert space is thus spanned by CF levels
(the fully filled ones gives the Jain ν = N/(2nN + 1)
states) and their PH conjugates (giving Jain states with
ν = N/(2nN − 1)). We can denote it as the base space
of the effective field theory. In particular, it is the full
Hilbert space of LLL for n = 1. For n > 1, the base space
is H2bdy
n−1 .

To determine if and how many Haldane modes need
to be added to effective field theory, it all depends on
if the long wavelength limit of the GMP mode lives en-
tirely within the base space. For n = 1 this is definitely
the case, since the GMP mode lives entirely within the
LLL as illustrated in Fig.6(a). In particular, the regu-
larised density operator δ ¯ρq is PH symmetric. For n > 1,
the GMP modes for all the Laughlin states live entirely
within the base space, but δ ¯ρq is no longer PH symmet-
ric within the base space. One can also show rigorously
from the microscopic point of view that all Jain states at
ν = N/(2nN ±1) with N > 1 have GMP modes partially
outside of the base space, thus requiring at least one ad-

FIG. 6. Number of Haldane modes with different
structure of CHSs. Laughlin states (N = 1, η = 1)
are denoted by the white point in the corresponding CHS
(blue circle). For the Jain states at N/(2nN + η), (a) with
n = 1, N > 1, η = ±1, (e.g. the FQH state at 2/3 and 2/5,
etc.), because δ ρq = δ ρ∗
q, these states will show the same be-
haviour as the Laughlin state at 1/3, i.e. one peak with no
Haldane mode required. When n > 1, (b) shows that a single
Haldane mode is needed in the effective field theory despite
two peaks observed in the spectral function, among which
given n, the states with N = 2, η = −1 can be regarded
as the particle-hole conjugate partner of the corresponding
Laughlin state within some specific CHS, and the states with
N > 1, η = 1 are the states in higher CF levels as shown in
Fig.2(b). (c) and (d) show more possibilities and lead to the
conclusion that the number of Haldane modes added to the
effective theory cannot be easily reckoned from the number of
peaks in the spectral function I(E), which is closely related
to the microscopic Hamiltonian used.

ditional Haldane mode to be added to the effective field
theory as illustrated in Fig.6(b).
In principle we can have multiple CHSs containing
the base space with the hierarchical structure Hbase ⊂
H1 ··· ⊂ Hk with k > 1, and the GMP mode resides in
Hk having non-zero weights in all Hk(cid:48)<k. We have not
found such cases for Jain states with CHSs defined by
two-body and three-body PPs, but it may be possible for
other FQH states, or for CHSs defined by few-body PPs
involving clusters of more than three electrons. These
cases are illustrated by Fig.6(c), where more than one
Haldane modes are needed for the effective field theory,
for it to agree with microscopic Hamiltonians that can
resolve those CHSs in terms of energy.

Numerical calculations are essential in verifying the ef-
fective field theory predictions, but it is important to
note that the number of Haldane modes needed for the
effective field theory does not necessarily correspond to
the number of peaks in the graviton spectral function,
since the latter depends on the microscopic details of

(a) (b)(c)(d)**''0Haldane Mode1 Peak in I(E)n=1n>12 Haldane Mode3 Peak in I(E)1 Haldane Mode3 Peak in I(E)1 Haldane Mode2 Peaks in I(E)PHConjugatePeaksthe Hamiltonian. Fig.6(d) is another example that even
within the base space there can be multiple CHSs, which
can be resolved by proper model Hamiltonians. With
such interactions the GM within the base space (which is
the conventional graviton, not the Haldane modes) can
lead to multiple spectral weight peaks well separated in
energy, though the total weight is captured by the cou-
pling of the composite particles with the Hall manifold
metric in the effective theory.

In fact, from an effective theory point of view, we
can always use a single Haldane mode to capture all the
GM weights outside of the base space, while all the GM
weights within the base space can be captured by the
usual composite particle action. While the known Dirac
CF description for the Haldane mode strictly speaking
only applies to the FQH states very close to ν = 1/(2n)

9
(i.e. for Jain states ν = N/(2nN ± 1) with N → ∞, and
definitely does not apply for Laughlin states at N = 1),
the general arguments here with the relationship between
the GMP modes and the base space should apply to all ef-
fective field theory description, with or without particle-
hole symmetry.
