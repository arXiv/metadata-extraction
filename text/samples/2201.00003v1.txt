Abstract

We consider the steady heat conduction problem within a thermal isotropic
and homogeneous infinite strip composite reinforced by uniformly and ran-
domly distributed non-overlapping carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and containing
voids. We treat the CNTs as thin perfectly conducting elliptic inclusions and
assume the voids to be of circular shape and act as barriers to heat flow. We
also impose isothermal conditions on the external boundaries by assuming the
lower infinite wall to be a heater under a given temperature, and the upper
wall to be a cooler that can be held at a lower fixed temperature. The equa-
tions for the temperature distribution are governed by the two-dimensional
Laplace equation with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions. The
resulting boundary value problem is solved using the boundary integral equa-
tion with the generalized Neumann kernel. We illustrate the performance of
the proposed method through several numerical examples including the case
of the presence a large number of CNTs and voids.

Introduction

Nanofibers embedded in polymer matrices have attracted attention as one of the
reinforcements for composite materials. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) reinforced poly-
mer nanocomposites are considered as conventional micro- and macro-composites
[1]. Their thermal, mechanical, and electric properties are determined by experi-
mental and theoretical investigations [2, 3, 4]. CNTs are considered as perfectly
conducting inclusions, which suggests imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions on
the boundary of CNTs. On the other hand, the classical problems for materials
with holes in porous media and materials with voids and insulting inclusions are
modeled by the Neumann boundary condition [5, 6].

The present paper is devoted to the heat conduction within a 2D (two-dimensional)

thermal isotropic and homogeneous nanocomposite, which takes the form of an infi-
nite strip, when it is reinforced by non-overlapping and randomly distributed CNTs

and contains defects and voids.
In particular, we are interested in studying the
effect of CNTs as well as of the presence of voids on the macroscopic conductive and
mechanical properties of this composite. Owing to the superconductivity of CNTs
and the extremely low conductivity of voids, we can assume that the conductiv-
ity of CNTs, of the polymer host and of voids to be governed by the inequalities
λc (cid:29) λ (cid:29) λ0. Such an assumption leads to a mixed boundary value problem
where the latter inequality becomes +∞ (cid:29) λ (cid:29) 0. The host conductivity can be
normalized to unity, i.e., λ = 1.

Theoretical investigation of mixed boundary value problems by integral equa-
tions can be found in [7, 8]. In the same time, implementation of numerical methods
for large number of inclusions and holes is still a challenging problem of applied and
computational mathematics. We propose in this work a fast and effective algorithm
for the numerical solution of the formulated mixed boundary value problem. The
method is based on the boundary integral equation with the generalized Neumann
kernel. The integral equation has been used in [8] to solve a similar mixed bound-
ary value problem related to the capacity of generalized condensers. The proposed
method can be even employed when the number of perfectly conducting inclusions
and holes is very large.

As a result of simulations, we first study the 2D local fields for three types of me-
dia. In the first type, we consider the case of pure m void cracks with m = 5, 30, 50.
The second type consists of pure (cid:96) CNT inclusions with (cid:96) = 5 and 200. Finally, we
treat the case of a large number of combined inclusions and holes by considering
either 2000 of one of the two or 1000 of each. Afterward, we take up the systematic
investigation of the effective conductivity of the considered composites. It is im-
portant in applications to predict the macroscopic properties of composites which
depend on the concentration of perfectly conducting CNTs as well as on the concen-
tration of holes and voids. It is worth noting that the notation of concentration are
different for slit shapes of CNTs and circular shapes of holes. The performed sim-
ulations of local fields and computation of their averaged conductivities for various
concentrations allows to establish the dependence of the macroscopic conductivity
on the main geometrical parameters.

2 Problem formulation

Let us consider a channel medium embedding m inhomogeneities in the form of (cid:96)
nanofillers and p = m − (cid:96) holes (voids). As many nanofillers (e.g, carbon nanon-
tubes [9]) have cross sections of elliptical shapes, we model them as ellipses C1, . . . , C(cid:96).
Furthermore, we represent the non-conducting holes by inner circles C(cid:96)+1, . . . , Cm.
The top and bottom infinite walls of the channel are denoted respectively by C(cid:48)
0
and C(cid:48)(cid:48)
0 , which yields a multiply connected domain Ω of connectivity m + 1 with a
0 . An example of this domain for the

boundary set C =(cid:83)m

case of (cid:96) = 4 and m = 7 is illustrated in Figure 1.

k=0 Ck where C0 = C(cid:48)

0 ∪ C(cid:48)(cid:48)

The medium matrix without inhomogeneities is supposed to be homogeneous
and isotropic with a constant thermal conductivity λ = 1. We also assume that
conduction is the only dominating mechanism of heat transfer in the medium. Ex-
cept being non-overlapping, no other restriction is imposed on the inhomogeneities
as they can be placed at random orientation and position.

The nanofillers are treated as heat superconductors with an almost uniform tem-
perature distribution within each one. Therefore the temperature T is assumed to

3

be fixed to an indeterminate constant value δk along each ellipse Ck for k = 1 . . . , (cid:96).
This assumption is consistent with the numerical results reported in [10] for CNT
reinforced polymer composites. Furthermore, by the law of energy conservation in
steady-state heat conduction, there should be no net thermal flow through each
nanofiller. This constraint is written by means of the net heat flux boundary con-
dition (1e).

On the other hand, the curves C(cid:96)+1, . . . , Cm are assumed to be perfect insulators
and therefore they act as barriers to heat flow. Henceforth, the Neumann boundary
condition (1f) is imposed along the holes contours. Finally, isothermal conditions
are imposed on the external boundaries by assuming that the lower infinite wall is
a heater of temperature T1, and the upper wall acts as a heat sink, which can be
held at a fixed temperature T0 < T1. Thee two values T0 and T1 of the temperature
on the external boundaries are normalized to 0 and 1, respectively.

Under steady-state conditions, Fourier's law of heat conduction and the above
specified heat boundaries conditions yield the temperature distribution T governed
by the following mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary value problem:

3 The integral equation method

The boundary integral equation with the generalized Neumann kernel is not di-
rectly applicable to the above boundary value problem (1) because of the external
boundary component. However, the boundary value problem (1) is invariant under

conformal mapping. The mapping function

z = Φ(ζ) =

conformally maps the unit disk ζ < 1 onto the infinite strip 0 < Im z < 1. Thus,
the inverse mapping

ζ = Φ−1(z) = tanh

(cid:18) πz

(cid:19)

conformally maps the infinite strip 0 < Im z < 1 onto the unit disk ζ < 1, the real
axis onto the lower half of the unit circle, the line Im z = 1 onto the upper half of
the unit circle, and satisfies Φ−1(±∞ + 0i) = ±1. Consequently, the function Φ−1
maps the multiply connected domain Ω in the z-plane (the physical domain) onto a
multiply connected domain G in the ζ-plane interior of the unit circle and exterior
of m smooth Jordan curves (the computational domain). In Figure 2, we display
the result of the conformal mapping of the example shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1.

It follows that the harmonic function T can be written as

T (z) = U (Φ−1(z))

in which the function U is the solution of the following boundary value problem in
the ζ-plane:

where Γ(cid:48)
that the restriction of the function U (ζ) on the external boundary is discontinuous
at ζ = ±1. However, the function U can be cast into the form

0 = Φ−1(C(cid:48)(cid:48)

For the orientation of the boundary components of G, we assume that Γ0 is

We assume that each boundary component Γk, k = 0, 1, . . . , m, is parametrized by a
2π-periodic function ηk(t), t ∈ Jk := [0, 2π] such that η(cid:48)
k(t) (cid:54)= 0. Let J be the disjoint
union of the m + 1 intervals J0, . . . , Jm, the whole boundary Γ is parametrized by
the complex function η defined on J by [11, 12]

Note that the unit circle Γ0 is parametrized by η0(t) = eit, t ∈ J0 = [0, 2π].
Let n(ζ) be the unit outward normal vector at ζ ∈ Γ and let ν(ζ) be the angle
between the normal vector n(ζ) and the positive real axis. Then, for ζ = η(t) ∈ Γ,

n(ζ) = eiν(ζ) = −i

The harmonic function u can be assumed to be a real part of an analytic function
f (ζ), ζ ∈ G. The boundary conditions (3b) and (3c) give the real parts of the
function f (ζ) on Γk for k = 0, 1, . . . , (cid:96). Specifically, we have

For the remaining boundary components Γk for k = (cid:96) + 1, . . . , m, we use the con-
dition (3e) to determine the boundary condition on f (η). By the Cauchy-Riemann

where the integration constants δk are undetermined. The constants δk, k = 1, . . . , m
in (10) and (12) are determined so that f (z) is a single-valued analytic function.

Since we are interested in the function u, the real part of f , we may assume that
c = f (α) is real for some given point α in G. Define an analytic function g(ζ) in
the domain G through

f (ζ) = (ζ − α)g(ζ) + c.

It is clear that the function γ is known and the piecewise constant function h is
unknown and should be determined. Let µ(t) = Im[A(t)g(η(t))], i.e., the boundary
values of an analytic function g are given by

g(η(t)) =

γ(t) + h(t) + iµ(t)

A(t)

t ∈ J.

,

(18)

Thus, in order to find the boundary values of the analytic function g, we need to
determine the two unknown functions µ and h. These two functions can be computed
using the boundary integral equation with the generalized Neumann kernel [11, 12,
13].

Let H be the space of all real Holder continuous functions on Γ, let I be the

identity operator, and let the integral operators N and M are defined on H by

of the integral equation

(I − N)µ = −Mγ.

(19)

(20)

Additionally, the piecewise constant function h is given by

h = [Mµ − (I − N)γ]/2.

We compute approximations to the functions µ in (19) and h in (20) by the
MATLAB function fbie from [12]. This function employs a discretization of the
integral equation (19) by the Nystrom method using the trapezoidal rule [14] to
obtain an algebraic linear system of size (m+1)n×(m+1)n where n is the number of
discretization points in each boundary component. The resulting system is solved by
applying the generalized minimal residual method through the MATLAB function
gmres. The matrix-vector multiplication in gmres is computed using the MATLAB
function zfmm2dpart from the FMMLIB2D MATLAB toolbox [15]. The values of the
other parameters in the function fbie are chosen as in [16]. For more details, we
refer the reader to [12].

4 Computing the temperature distribution and

the heat flux

By computing µ and h, we obtain the boundary values of the function g through (18).
The values of the function g(ζ) for ζ ∈ G can be computed by the Cauchy integral
formula. For the numerical computation of g(ζ) for ζ ∈ G, we use the MATLAB
function fcau from [12]. Then, the values of f (ζ) can be computed by (13) and
hence the values of the solution of the boundary value problem (2) is given for
ζ ∈ G by

We deduce the values of the temperature distribution T (z) for any z ∈ Ω by

U (ζ) = Re [f (ζ) + f0(ζ)] .

T (z) = Re(cid:2)f (Φ−1(z)) + f0(Φ−1(z))(cid:3) .

Moreover, by computing the piecewise constant function h, we can compute as well
the values of the undetermined real constants c, δ1, . . . , δm from (16).

The function T (z) is the real part of the function
F (z) = f (Φ−1(z)) + f0(Φ−1(z)),

z ∈ Ω.

According to the Cauchy-Riemann equations, it follows that the derivative of the
complex potential F (z) on Ω is given by

F (cid:48)(z) =

∂T
∂x

− i

∂T

One the other hand,

F (cid:48)(z) =

Φ(cid:48)(Φ−1(z))

,

+

z ∈ Ω,

(21)

where the denominator does not vanish in the domain Ω since Φ is a conformal
mapping. Therefore the heat flux can be expressed for z ∈ D in terms of F (cid:48)(z) by
the formula

The derivatives f(cid:48)

(23)
0(Φ−1(z) and Φ(cid:48)(Φ−1(z)) in (21) can be computed analytically.
So, the values of the heat flux q can be estimated on the domain Ω by first approx-
imating the derivatives of the boundary values of the analytic function f on each
boundary components. This can be done by approximating the function f (η(t))
using trigonometric interpolating polynomials then differentiating. The values of
f(cid:48)(Φ−1(z)), in the right-hand side of (21), can be then computed for z ∈ Ω using
the Cauchy integral formula.

5 Computing the effective thermal conductivity

The medium matrix without inhomogeneities is assumed to be homogeneous and
isotropic. We will assume that the CNTs and the circular voids are in the part of
the domain between x = −1 and x = 1. Thus, the effective conductivity of a layer
in the y-direction λy is calculated by the formula (3.2.33) from the book [6, p. 53],

Since eit1 and eit2 are on the unit circle Γ0, the external boundary of G, and taking
into account (13), (14), (15), and (18), Equation (29) can be written as

By solving the integral equation (19), we obtain approximate values of µ at the
discretization points. These values are employed to interpolate the approximate
solution µ on J0 by a trigonometric interpolation polynomial, which is then used to
approximate the values of µ(t1) and µ(t2).

6 Numerical results

The above proposed method with n = 211 is applied to compute the temperature
field T and the heat flux q for several examples. We will choose the CNTs and the
circular voids within the part of the domain between x = −1 and x = 1. To compute
the values of the temperature distribution T and the heat flux q, we discretize part
of the domain Ω, namely for −1.5 ≤ x ≤ 1.5 and 0.0001 ≤ y ≤ 0.9999. Afterwards,
we compute the values of the temperature distribution T and the heat flux q at
these points as described in Section 4.

6.1 The domain Ω with only circular voids

In this subsection, we consider the domain Ω with m non-overlapping circular holes
and without any CNT (i.e., (cid:96) = 0). We also assume that all circular holes have the
same radius r with the parametrization

ηj(t) = zj + re−it,

0 ≤ t ≤ 2π,

j = 1, 2, . . . , m,

where z1, z2, . . . , zm are the centers of the circular holes. As these circular holes
are chosen in the part of the domain Ω between x = −1 and x = 1, we define the
concentration c(m, r) of these voids to be the area of these circular holes over the
area of the rectangle {(x, y) : −1 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1}, i.e.,

c(m, r) =

mr2π

.

(31)

11

The Clausius-Mossotti approximation (CMA) also known as Maxwel's formula
can be applied for dilute composites when the concentration (31) is sufficiently small.
Below, we write this formula for a macroscopically isotropic media with insulators
of identical circular holes within the precisely established precision in [17]

1 − c
1 + c

λe =

+ O(c3).

(32)

Example 1 We consider m = 5 circular holes with the radius r for 0 < r < 0.2.
For Case I, we assume the centers of the holes to be set to −0.8 + 0.5i, −0.4 + 0.5i,
0.5i, 0.4 + 0.5i, and 0.8 + 0.5i. The contour plot of T and q for r = 0.1 are shown
in Figure 3 (first row). The approximate value of the effective thermal conductivity
for r = 0.1 is

λy = 0.8533491.

When r is close to 0.2, the circular holes become adjacent to each other. To show
the effects of the radius r on the effective thermal conductivity λy, we compute the
values of λy for several values of r, 0.00001 ≤ r ≤ 0.19999. The obtained results
are presented in Figure 4 where, by (31), the concentration of these 5 holes is
c = c(5, r) = 5r2π/2 ≈ 7.854r2 for 0 < c < π/10 and 0 < r < 0.2. The values of
the estimated effective conductivity λe is given also in Figure 4. As one can expect,
there is a good agreement between λy and λe for small values of c. In the same time,
the divergence of λy and λe is observed for the concentrations greater than 0.1.
For Case II, the centers of the holes become −0.8+0.5i, −0.4+0.3i, 0.5i, 0.4+0.7i,
and 0.8 + 0.5i, which means the centers are not anymore horizontally aligned as the
second and fourth centers are now shifted by 0.2 up and down, respectively. This is
displayed in Figure 3 (second row). The curve showing the obtained values of λy as
a function of the concentration is depicted in Figure 4.

Figure 4 illustrates that the values of λy depend on the position of the circular
holes centers while the values of λe are the same for both cases since it depends only
on the concentration of the circular holes and not on their positions. We notice a
better agreement between λy and λe in Cases II when comparing to Case I.

Example 2 We consider m = 30 circular holes with centers xk + 0.25i, xk + 0.5i,
and xk + 0.75i, where xk = −0.9 + 0.2(k − 1) for k = 1, 2, . . . , 10, and with radius r
for 0 < r < 0.1. The contour plot of T and q for r = 0.099 are shown in Figure 5.
The approximate value of the effective thermal conductivity for r = 0.099 is

λy = 0.1519156.

When r is close to 0.1, the circular holes become adjacent to each other. We
compute the values of λy for several values of r, 0.00001 ≤ r ≤ 0.09999. The
obtained results are depicted in Figure 6 (left) where, by (31), the concentration of
these 30 holes is c = c(30, r) = 30r2π/2 ≈ 47.124r2. Note that 0 < c < 3π/20 for
0 < r < 0.1.

Example 3 We take up here the case of m = 50 circular holes with centers xk +0.1i,
xk + 0.3i, xk + 0.5i, xk + 0.7i, and xk + 0.9i, where xk = −0.9 + 0.2(k − 1) for
k = 1, 2, . . . , 10, and with radius r for 0 < r < 0.1. On the basis of (31), the
concentration of these 50 holes is c = c(50, r) = 50r2π/2 ≈ 78.54r2. For 0 < r < 0.1,

we have 0 < c < π/4. When r is close to 0.1, the circular holes become adjacent
to each other, and the concentration is almost equal to π/4. The obtained results
showing the behavior of λy as a function of the radius r, for 0.001 ≤ r ≤ 0.099, are
presented in Figure 6 (right).

6.2 The domain Ω with only CNTs

In this subsection, we consider the domain Ω with m non-overlapping elliptic CNTs
without any circular holes (i.e., m = (cid:96)). We assume that all CNTs have equal sizes
and are of elliptic shape where the ellipses have the parametrization

ηj(t) = zj + a cos t − ib sin t,

0 ≤ t ≤ 2π,

j = 1, 2, . . . , m,

(33)

where zj is the center of the ellipse, 2a and 2b are the length of the ellipses axes
in the x and y-directions, respectively. If a/b > 1, the major axis of the ellipses is

horizontal, if a/b < 1, the major axis of the ellipses is vertical, and if a/b = 1, the
ellipses reduced to circles. Here, we choose a and b such that their ratio satisfies
0.1 ≤ a/b ≤ 10. These elliptic shape CNTs are chosen in the part of the domain
Ω between x = −1 and x = 1. So, we define the concentration c(m, a, b) of these
CNTs to be

c(m, a, b) =

For a macroscopically isotropic media with only perfectly conducting identical
circular inclusions (CNTs), an approximation of the effective conductivity λe is given
by the inverse to (32) value (see [17])

λe =

1 + c
1 − c

+ O(c3).

(36)

Example 4 We consider m = 5 elliptic CNTs with centers −0.8 + 0.5i, −0.4 + 0.5i,
0.5i, 0.4 + 0.5i, and 0.8 + 0.5i, and where 0 < a < 0.2 and 0 < b < 0.5. Figure 7

14

(first row) presents the contour plot of T and q for a = 0.19 and b = 0.019 (the
ellipses are horizontal). For these values of a and b, the approximate value of the
effective thermal conductivity is

λy = 1.0272480.

For a = 0.019 and b = 0.19, the contour plot of T and q are shown in Figure 7
(second row). The approximate value of the effective thermal conductivity for these
values of a and b is

λy = 1.2804116.

The CNTs in Figure 7 have the same concentration. However, the value of λy is
larger for the vertical ellipses case.

When a approaches 0.2, the ellipses get adjacent to each other. On the other
hand, they come close to the upper and lower walls when b approaches 0.5. We
compute the values of λy for several values of a, 0.0001 ≤ a ≤ 0.1999, with b =
0.1a. The obtained results are presented in Figure 8 (left) where, by (34), the
concentration of these 5 ellipses is c = c(5, a, b) = 5abπ/2 = a2π/4 ≈ 0.7854a2.
Note that, for 0 < a < 0.2 and b = 0.1a, we have 0 < c < π/100.
The values of λy are also computed for several values of b for 0.001 ≤ b ≤ 0.499
with a = 0.1b. Since a/b = 0.1 is small, the obtained values of λy are plotted versus
the values of φ = 2.5b2, given by (35), where 0 < φ < 5/8 for 0 < b < 0.5. The
obtained results are presented in Figure 8 (right).

Example 5 We consider m = 200 elliptic CNTs with centers xk + iyj for k =
1, 2, . . . , 20 and j = 1, 2, . . . , 10 where xk = −0.95 + (k − 1)/10 and yj = 0.05 + (j −
1)/10, and with 0 < a < 0.05 and 0 < b < 0.05.
We compute the values of λy for several values of a, 0.0002 ≤ a ≤ 0.0498,
and a/b = 10 (i.e., the ellipses are horizontal) where the ellipses become close to
each other when a approaches 0.05. The obtained results are presented in Figure 9

of λy for several values of b, 0.0002 ≤ b ≤ 0.0498, and a/b = 0.1. The obtained
results for λy versus the the plane slits density φ = mb2/2 = 100b2 are presented in

6.3 The domain Ω with 2000 CNTs and/or circular voids

We are concerned in this section with the study of a large number of perfect con-
ductors and/or insulators. We consider two example where in the first both perfect
conductors and insulators have the same circular shape, while in the second, con-
ductors have an elliptic shape and insulators have a circular shape. The present
investigation is useful when studying the impact of geometric shapes on the macro-
scopic properties of three-phases high contrast media.

Example 6 We take m = 2000 circular holes of equal size with radius r = 0.0075.
In this example, the concentration c = c(m, r) = 1000r2π ≈ 0.1767 is constant
and the locations of these holes are chosen randomly. In this case, the following
extension of CMA may be used

λe =

1 + c1 − c2
1 − c1 + c2

+ O(c3),

(37)

where c1 denotes the conductor concentration, c2 the insulator concentration, and
c = c1 + c2. Three cases are considered:

Case I: We assume that half of the holes are CNTs and the other half are voids (see
Figure 11). For this case, c1 and c2 are given by c1 = c2 = 500r2π ≈ 0.0884.

Case II: All holes are voids, and hence c1 = 0 while c2 = 1000r2π ≈ 0.1767.
Case III: All holes are CNTs, and hence c1 = 1000r2π ≈ 0.1767 while c2 = 0.

For each case, we run the code for 20 times, so that to get 20 different locations
for these circular holes. In each of these 20 experiments, we compute the value of
the effective thermal conductivity λy by the presented method and the values of the
estimated effective conductivity λe by (32). As we can see from Figure 12, λe is a
constant and the values of λy depend on the locations of the holes.

17

Figure 11: The domain Ω with m = 2000 circular holes. Case I: We have p = 1000
voids (blue circles) and (cid:96) = 1000 CNTs (red circles).

Example 7 We consider m = 2000 elliptic and circular holes with (cid:96) = 1000 elliptic
perfect conductors and p = 1000 circular insulators of equal area πr2 (see Figure 13).
The radius r is chosen to be the same as in the previous example, i.e., r = 0.0075.
The locations of both elliptic and circular holes are chosen randomly. For the ellipses,
we assume that the ratio between the length of the major axis and the minor axis
is 4, and the angles between the major axis and the x-axis are chosen randomly.
As in the previous example, we run the code for 20 times.
In each of these 20
experiments, we compute the value of the effective thermal conductivity λy by the
presented method. The computed values are shown in Figure 13 (left).

Since we have the same number of elliptic perfect conductors and circular insu-
lators of equal area πr2, the conductor concentration c1 and the insulator concen-
tration c2 are equal and given by c1 = c2 = 500r2π ≈ 0.0884. Although c1 and c2
here are the same as in Case I of the previous example, it is clear from Figures 12
(first row) and 13 (right) that the values λy in this example (elliptic conductors) are
larger than those in the previous example (circular conductors).

row, left), and Case III (second row, right).

values of the effective thermal conductivity λy vs. the number of the experiment.

19

6.4 The dependence of λy on φ and c

We consider now a domain domain Ω with m = (cid:96) = 276 non-overlapping elliptic
CNTs without any void. We assume that all CNTs are of equal size and elliptic
shape. The ellipses are parametrized by (33) with a < b, which means they are
taken to be vertical.
First we assume that the concentration c = c(m, a, b) is constant and we choose
the values of the parameters a and b such that the plane slits density φ = φ(m, a, b) ∈
[0.4, 1.3]. The domain Ω for c = 0.5 and φ = 1.3 is shown in Figure 14. We consider
as well five values of the concentration, c = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5. Then, for each of
these values, we compute and show in Figure 15 (left) the values of λy = λy(φ).

Afterwards, we take up the plane slits density φ = φ(m, a, b) to be constant
and we choose the values of the parameters a and b such that the concentration
c = c(m, a, b) ∈ [0.1, 0.5]. We consider four values of φ, φ = 0.4, 0.7, 1, 1.3, and
compute again λy = λy(c) for each case. The obtained results are presented in
Figure 15 (right).

Figure 14: The domain Ω with m = 276 elliptic CNTs for c = 0.5 and φ = 1.3.

elliptic CNTs. On the left, the values of λy = λy(φ) for φ ∈ [0.4, 1.3] and for several
values of c. On the right, the values of λy = λy(c) for c ∈ [0.1, 0.5] and for several
values of φ.

7 Conclusion

A systematic estimation of the local fields and the effective conductivity properties
of 2D composites reinforced by uniformly and randomly distributed CNTs is car-
ried out. It is assumed that the medium may contains voids as well. The CNTs
are considered as perfectly conducting elliptic inclusions and the voids as circular
insulators. For definiteness, a composite strip is considered with the given constant
external field passing through the strip. The local field is governed by the Laplace
equation in the multiply connected domain formed by the strip without two types
of holes, CNTs and voids. The Dirichlet boundary condition is imposed on the
CNTs boundary and the Neumann boundary condition governs the void boundary.
A numerical method is developed to solve the mixed problem for a large number
of CNTs and voids. The method is based on using the boundary integral equation
with the generalized Neumann kernel [11, 12]. One key feature of this method is
that it can be employed for domains with complex geometry as it provides accurate
results even when the boundaries are close together. To solve the integral equation,
the Fast Multipole Method has been employed, which enables to treat the case of
thousands of CNTs and voids. With the help of conformal mappings, the presented
method can be extended to include the case when CNTs and voids are rectilinear
slits as done in [16] for example.

The computational study has shown a dependence of the local fields and the
effective conductivity λy on the concentration of voids c given by (34) as well as
on the density φ of CNTs given by (35). Besides the opposite conductive proper-
ties, voids and CNTs have also different types of the geometric parameters c and
φ that are not reduced to each other. Hence, the present study is concerned ad-
ditionally with the case of three-phase composites of high contrast conductivity.
It is demonstrated that our simulations are covered with the classical lower order
approximations (Clausius-Mossotti, Maxwell) for dilute composites. The high or-
der concentrations and densities led to different results from the classical ones. It
is worth noting that the huge number of numerical experiments for uniformly dis-
tributed inclusions yield the graphical dependencies of λy on c and φ, which can be
used in practical applications.
